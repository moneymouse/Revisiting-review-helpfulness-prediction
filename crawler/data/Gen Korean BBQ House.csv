All you can eat KBBQ doesn&#39;t warrant high quality meat, but some meats I couldn&#39;t be paid to bite through. Don&#39;t order the steak. This is the least full I have ever been after AYCE.<br><br>My party ordered:<br>-&#34;Gen Premium&#34; Steak - 0/5<br>- Beef bulgogi - 3/5<br>- Spicy Pork bulgogi - 3/5<br>- Brisket - 2/5<br><br>- Popcorn Chicken - 1/5<br>- Calamari - 1/5<br>- Yangyum Galbi - N/A<br>- Nook Gan Sal - 2/5<br><br>Let me start by saying this place is objectively not clean. I felt my shoes slipping on oil or grease. Please clean your floors. I wonder if that&#39;s why the lights are so dim in here. We get to the table and there are no tongs?<br><br>The side dishes were okay--definitely nothing to write home about. They gave us free rice at the start, which would&#39;ve been nice had we not finished our rice, then requested more. This request was met with a 15-20 minute wait. This is somewhat unacceptable for a bowl of rice at this establishment, I would like to think. It appeared that there aren&#39;t that many dishes made by chefs, so one would think that having some rice going is pretty easy, but maybe the kitchen is understaffed or something. We also didn&#39;t get any sauce dishes. I feel these are pretty standard at kbbq. Pretty sure U-Grill down the street has sauce dishes or at least salt to dilute the blandness of some meats.<br><br>The meat that came was ok at best. Definitely lower end of meat quality. The best item out of those that we ordered was the spicy pork bulgogi, followed by the beef bulgogi. The marinades carry their flavor. All non-marinated items were pretty bland and chewy. The galbi never even came to our table.<br><br>Finally, the calamari was suspect at best and the popcorn chicken was oily and gross. Presentation was as shown in the pictures, which is to say, terrible.<br><br>Service - 1/5<br>Nathan must&#39;ve been new, because better service should be expected of tenured waiters. On numerous occasions, we would order and then he would disappear without returning for over half an hour (just too long to be ok). I&#39;m not sure how their service system works, but we received the wrong food on numerous occasions (3 i think). We never got the galbi despite waiting for ~40 total minutes for our second round. The calamari and popcorn chicken came at the very end of our meal after we had all but paid. A member of our party had to go to the bar to get a beer because they never brought it.",8/28/2022,2,2,4,0,0,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kMBeXrOCTSfzj-C9Ms35yA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/alvx3oAwx2YgGZRJEsO7Zg/o.jpg,,,,,,,,

I asked a different waiter because she would not come to the table for our drinks. Through our dinner she never took out our dirty plates but she did take other peoples plates.

When she finally came I did let her know of the stuff that was missing and that I would like check. I did speak to a manager and let them know because they had put a hot grill on top and that could be dangerous it it falls.

Our waitress was excellent, wished I could of gotten his name. He interacted with my son which that&#39;s always a plus for me. Also loved how he would always check up on our table, and if we needed drink refills he would bring them to us. The food was great, it was delicious. Only down side is that they had ran out of hot sauce. (I love hot sauce on my food) Also, even though the restaurant closed at 11 we never felt we got rushed to get out of there.

Ok thanks. Our first order still didn&#39;t arrive for 10 minutes... it&#39;s raw meat, so what&#39;s the hold up? Not like they had to butcher the pigs and cows out back.<br><br>We had two different servers the whole time. Every time we ordered they would screw it up. We ordered 2 plates of brisket, they would bring 1 plate. We ordered a round of rice THREE TIMES and they never came. Everything we asked for, never came. We were seated for TWO HOURS and only had food delivered THREE TIMES. We literally left hangry, and pissed. We were seriously so hungry on our last hour there, we were licking our small banchan bowls clean. And those are complimentary AKA FREE. Top it off we ran out of banchan in our first 15 minutes there - they never bothered giving us more. We also ran out of drinks within 30 minutes, they never bothered to get us refills. We had a stack of empty/dirty raw meat plates, rice bowls, and banchan dishes sitting on our table - took them a whole HOUR to clear them.<br><br>Service was so shitty, we almost contemplated leaving without paying. <br><br>Also the amount of meat they brought out was literally enough for one person, and there was 3 of us. I&#39;m giving 1 star because the quality of meat was actually really good, but also because yelp requires at least 1 star to review.

Upon entering, it looks like you&#39;re stepping into a night club. It was cool! <br><br>After eating at various establishments, I have a grill preference. It&#39;s annoying when you constantly have to change grill tops &amp; have to wait for them to preheat because they char and smoke. During our meal, we only changed tops once. The grills are solid metal &amp; slightly dome shaped with holes around the circumference to drain the grease. No unsightly grease pooling in a tray that has to be changed multiple times during the meal here.<br><br>The portions here are very generous. I&#39;d almost suggest ordering a partial portion of new meats that you&#39;re trying so you&#39;re not left either stuffed or with leftovers that you can&#39;t take home.<br><br>I honestly have no idea how this place turns a profit because the meat quality is great and weekday lunch is $15 pp. The sirloin steak was insane - thick, with a wonderful fat &#34;rind.&#34; The bulgogi was the best I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;d say skip all the poultry if you even remotely enjoy beef - it&#39;s that good. <br><br>I like that the banchan was served in tiny portions so that you could fill up on meat.

My friends and I came here for a birthday and we were seated instantly (probably because it was only a party of 4). Our hostess was extremely attentive and made some good recommendations on how to cook the intestines if we were going to order them. <br><br>At our table were side dishes &amp; a huge bowl of house salad. Our waitress, Loren was super friendly and was constantly asking us if we needed any refills or anymore orders. For our first round, we ordered: spicy pork bulgogi, spicy pork belly, large intestines, &amp; beef bulgogi. The food came out quickly &amp; it didn&#39;t take long before we demolish all of our meat! My personal favorite was the spicy beef bulgogi &amp; the spicy pork belly for round 1. While the intestine were crispy, it wasn&#39;t much of anything to me and it took a bit too long to cook. The beef bulgogi was also good, however, I did not enjoy the sweetness to it as much. I mean it was still pretty bomb! <br><br>For our second round, we ordered: garlic pork belly, regular pork belly, kalbi short ribs, chicken bulgogi, &amp; some glass noodles w/ vegetables. Once again, all the meats were delicious. I liked the original pork belly a lot better than the garlic pork belly. However, my housemates seem to enjoyed the garlic pork belly a lot more. It all comes down to reference! I like my pork belly cooked w/ a sprinkle of salt, that&#39;s why I prefer the original one. However, I do like the spicy pork belly more than the original. But like I said, it&#39;s really your personal preference! The glass noodles was a bit TOO chewy for my liking.  <br><br>For our third and last round, we had more spicy pork bulgogi, pork belly, spicy rice cakes, &amp; this time we tried the small intestines. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the small intestines since it had a bitter taste to it and it was super chewy. I really like the spicy rice cakes since it was all fried and chewy but I could use it without the sauce. <br><br>Since it was my friends birthday, the waiters/waitress came to sing her a song &amp; gave her some pineapples while they held up a match so she can blow it out. It was awesome, ghetto, &amp; hilarious @ the same time! <br><br>Overall I would give this place a 4/5 stars because the food was delicious &amp; the service was friendly! However, the portions of the meat were little &amp; only fed up to 2 people. So if you had a party of 2+ you would have to order double &amp; it is only recommended that you order 4 dishes per round! Also, it was only $19.99 per person for dinner &amp; they had such a large meau compare to other AYCE Korean BBQ, it was def worth it!<br><br>I would definitely come back next time ;)",3/18/2015,4,4,1,1,0,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tmwiIcJJ7fup0hEbAEw2Fg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mszUoHlNO55Z-RtbjmkUag/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sWYfNXWQRPJfU7ewW60Y5A/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ukwB0Um4lyDz-Tbzn0fHbQ/o.jpg,,,,,,

Gen has several locations in Southern California and offers a good selection of meats to grill at your table.<br><br>LOCATION / PARKING<br>You&#39;ll find this Gen on Foothill Blvd, just west of Victoria Gardens. It shares the same lot as Wabi Sabi Steak House &amp; Sushi Bar. It&#39;s always hard to find parking in the area so prepare to easily find a spot further from the restaurant.<br><br>WAIT TIME<br>My first visit here was for a birthday so we had a good amount of tables reserved for us on the upper level with zero wait time! We literally walked in and told them we had reservations, and we walked right up to our reserved area---and our entire party wasn&#39;t there yet! Second visit was a little longer for myself and one other person. Third visit was no more than 15 minutes! All times I&#39;ve visited were during dinner hours.<br><br>AMBIENCE / ATMOSPHERE<br>If you&#39;re looking for a loud, club-like feel for dinner, then Gen KBBQ will deliver! The bright neon lights make for a fun and lively atmosphere on the main, lower level. While still loud, the upper level seating provides less lighting--although you still see some of the lights coming through from below. This is not the place for a quiet evening!<br><br>FOOD / PRICE<br>For the quality of food offered, the price is great. Some meats come out plain while some are marinated. My favorite are the spicy ones. Also, this is a place where you&#39;ll have to cook your own food. You choose which meats you like (about 3-4 items at a time) and a server will bring them out to you (raw) to cook on the grill. They will not cook it for you so, if you don&#39;t feel like grilling your own meal, Gen may not be where you want to go.<br><br>CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>We had excellent service on our first visit at the upper level. Someone kept changing out our grill, refilling our drinks, and asking if we needed anything else. My second visit here was horrible. We had seats in the lower corner and our orders were mixed up with 3 other tables! So the table next to us got our orders while we got the orders placed by the other table next to us. It was a mess between the 4 tables. When I came with a group of friends on my third visit and ended up sitting in the same lower corner, I was a bit apprehensive due to the prior visit. Fortunately, it actually was quite the opposite! The only thing I don&#39;t like about Gen is how the suited guys wearing the 2-way earpieces were rather boorish to the servers. I know they&#39;re there to help keep guests eating within a time frame (2 hours) but it&#39;s obvious their sense of authority goes a bit overboard. We witnessed one guy talking down to one of the servers like some jerk. So rude! I don&#39;t like seeing that while having dinner. Perhaps go to the back (away from customers) and talk to the server politely? Just a suggestion.<br><br>STROLLERS / WALKERS / WHEELCHAIRS<br>Personally, I wouldn&#39;t want to take young children or babies near KBBQ restaurants for safety measures. However, as far as space is concerned, they do have spacious aisles to move around for all strollers, walkers, and wheelchairs. I&#39;m not sure there is elevator access to the upper level, however, as I only recall taking stairs to get up there.<br><br>Pros:<br>- Iced Green Tea is delicious!<br>- Price<br>- Food<br>- Modern, club-like atmosphere<br>- Spacious<br>- Upper level seating<br>- Grills are changed out often<br>- Ice Cream Macarons!!<br><br>Cons:<br>- Grill your own food<br>- You will smell like KBBQ (clothes, hair, skin!)<br>- Suited guys wearing ear-pieces<br>- Access to upper level<br>- Loud<br>- Parking<br>- Wait time<br>- Not for quick-dining<br><br>There are a few things to consider but, overall, Gen KBBQ&#39;s food ranks more superior than their inadequacy.",2/1/2016,4,3,40,28,34,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a5A-emHPPuZvHVFrAH3JGg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p5icVv8d6vkaV1APDZAwgQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zr9PEv8BAGLUS9idGh3PBw/o.jpg,,,,,,,

Lesson learned: don&#39;t settle for bar seating. <br><br>Let me start out with the positives. I like Gen. I&#39;ve been a regular for many years and have been to multiple locations, from Cerritos to Pasadena to the new one that opened up in Torrance recently. If you look at the glowing reviews for all of these locations, they usually share at least 4 stars or higher on Yelp. Why is that? It&#39;s easy: Gen has established a reputation for itself for delivering amazing KBBQ. I&#39;d be kidding myself though if I gave credit solely to the food. It&#39;s the SERVICE that will make or break any experience, regardless of how good the food tastes. And quite frankly Eric, your service made the whole experience tasteless. <br><br>- For starters, we couldn&#39;t barbecue our food. Initially we just awkwardly stared for 5 minutes at the flaccid beef brisket you gave us as it lay motionless on the grill, waiting for it to sizzle. It never did. The grill you gave us didn&#39;t allow enough air circulation and suffocated whatever flame that was trying to spark. After hailing you several times, you finally changed the grill without an apology. Thanks. This is getting off to a great start.<br><br>- It took forever to get any service. Whereas the parties surrounding us were getting prompt grill changes and having their water refilled on the dot, your lack of service made us believe we were no where to be seen. We actually had to hail other waiters to get our meal moving along. Would it have been too much to ask for to replace our charcoal-stained grill? Oh wait, no, that would involve being proactive. <br><br>- Where was the check? We talked to another waiter serving us if we could have the bill, who then gestured to you while you were taking a sip of water at the bar to come over. I understand not to mistake neglect for being busy when it comes to waitering, but honestly it didn&#39;t seem like you were attending to anyone at that moment. And if you were, you didn&#39;t tell us--no apologizes, no explanation. Just the bill, 10 minutes later after the fact. <br><br>It&#39;s unfortunate this happened, because I honestly liked going here up until yesterday. It&#39;s not the end of the world though, my girlfriend and I will probably just go to another Gen that delivers the same respectful and amazing service that&#39;s been consistent with all the previous experiences I&#39;ve had throughout the years. It won&#39;t be at this location though.",12/23/2015,1,3,6,9,0,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Hcb_sNzXz6Q11sDNV-p35A/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_maa6QDCLmak91OMd4UhPg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KFU5eum9RRTLhXxZNuyyBQ/o.jpg,,,,,,,

Made a reservation for 50 about 2 mths. for a family reunion. Unfortunate timing of a heatwave this weekend made certain planned activities a little trying, but dinner should not be one of them. <br><br>The air conditioner had broke at Gen, according to one of the waiters a couple of days ago. The solution the general manager came up with was to bring in 2 portable AC units for each floor. Those units brought the bottom floor down to 84, &amp; the top floor which we were on fluctuated between 87-89 degrees. If that AC unit had broken that day, it would be understandable but the fact that it had been broken, during a heat wave and our party was not informed is extremely rude. We should have been informed of the issue &amp; then we could decide what we wanted to do. <br><br>I dealt with two floor managers, one manager had zero concept of customer service while the other floor manager Chris was very professional. I explained to him my frustration with the situation &amp; he was very understanding to how uncomfortable my party was during dinner. He spoke with the general manager, which refused to come out of the office to deal with the situation. She offered little compensation for the issue. They took off $80 in alcohol charges &amp; gave us 10 free macaroon ice creams for the kids. But our bill was over a $1000 while we had to sweat while we ate! With a party of 50 very difficult to just get up and leave. <br><br>The last straw was when we were informed the reason the AC unit will not be fixed until Monday was because corporate would not authorize the budget to get someone out in an emergency. The solution for corporate was to allow their employees to suffer in long sleeve black shirts, while its 90 degrees in the restaurant, all so they can save some $$$. I will never eat there again, the way this corporation treats their customers &amp; employees is unacceptable.

The tri-tip and the brisket are out of this world good! We never walk out of here disappointed...we do walk out about two, maybe three pounds heavier though.

We were in town the same weekend as Hard Summer and wanted to get our KBBQ So.Cal style fix before we headed back to the Bay. We were super close to this location, and the reviews were great so we figured why not! It was also a plus that they opened at 11am for lunch. <br><br>The location itself is within a plaza with very spacious parking. We got there around 1055am and there were literally 3-5 parties waiting to go inside. I had an inkling that they went to the music festival too B) We were seated immediately and we could see they were going to be very busy very quickly, and that they were. Phung, our server was very well-mannered at tried his best to serve us as quickly as possible. The boyfriend and I saw that he was slammed with more than 5 parties in his area so we&#39;re not knocking down any starts due to the (slow, but not as fast as it could&#39;ve been) customer service. <br><br>The lunch price CANNOT be beat - $15.00 for AYCE KBBQ! My favorites were the beef bulgogi, short ribs, pineapple steak, angus beef, calamari and shrimp! Among the banchan, all the kimchi dishes were delish but my favorite was the mashed potatoes. Also, don&#39;t forget to order the seasonings on the side to give your meal a little bit more pizzazz (you&#39;ll see they&#39;re listed on the very bottom of the menu upon request only)<br><br>They changed the grill pretty often and the ventilation was very good, we didn&#39;t reek too much of KBBQ (which is to be expected when you dine at places like this). By the time we were finished with our meal (12:30 pm) the house was already packed and the wait was RIDICULOUS! <br><br>My tips - go here early, and expect a wait if you come in an hour or so after opening time. <br>Don&#39;t go for the macaroon ice cream sandwich ($3.50) - it&#39;s overpriced for this dinky little ice cream thing that&#39;s pretty flavorless.

After Seafood City (Filipino supermarket) opened over a year ago and Star Crab (Boiling Crab knockoff) began serving a few months ago, my wife and I were wondering when a decent KBBQ joint would show up in town. We love all of the Asian eateries in the San Gabriel Valley, but we don&#39;t always feel like making the half-hour drive. When we learned that GEN was opening after Christmas in our neck of the woods, we were excited, to say the least. <br><br>GEN went beyond our expectations in every aspect: food, service, value, and atmosphere. We began the new year with family visiting from out of town and took them here for lunch. Every person in our party was impressed with the restaurant&#39;s decor: it&#39;s hip and trendy, words that aren&#39;t usually associated with Rancho Cucamonga. It has a club-like feel to it, with good music in the background.<br><br>For our initial visit, service was close to overbearing: it seemed like every few minutes a server was checking on us and it felt like we were barely finishing a mouthful of food before somebody was asking if we needed anything else. The servers were friendly and helpful, though, so I chalked it up to a new crew still finding its legs. I&#39;d rather have too-eager-to-please servers, though, than ones who drop off your food and disappear until it&#39;s time to pay the bill.<br><br>That being said, the service for dinner the next night (yes, we enjoyed it so much, we went on consecutive days) was more in line with what I expected. Again, our servers were helpful and attentive, but didn&#39;t hover during our meal. Since this is a new restaurant in the area, I appreciated how helpful the staff was; even though I came here with KBBQ veterans, the servers clearly explained all of the dishes and offered good recommendations. They were quick to change out our grills and refill our drinks. <br><br>During both of our meals, we liked all of the meats we tried: pork belly, premium chadol (ribeye), prime sirloin, spicy pork bulgogi, galbi, garlic pork belly, garlic chicken, cajun shrimp, and the hawaiian steak. My favorites so far are the galbi, pork belly, and prime sirloin, and I also enjoyed the jap chae (glass noodles with veggies). All of the banchan were good, if not spectacular. The meat was definitely the star of the show, as it should be when you&#39;re happily grilling away. For $20 all-you-can-eat, this is a superb value and there are a lot of choices (by my count, 31 different meats; there are also some veggies, soups, and noodles available). You order four meats at a time and the portions are generous and served quickly. You won&#39;t leave hungry, but if possible, save a little room for one of their tasty macaron ice cream sandwiches.<br><br>Overall, a superb addition to the growing number of Asian restaurants in the area. Highly recommended.",1/3/2015,5,3,29,10,16,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/brGeJcz2hVQHqfmEElov_A/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hKMcMQPLbRRz_iNxwlu6wA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ACNrl6gn0Qi182jxqumVLQ/o.jpg,,,,,,,

I&#39;ve been waiting for something like this since I&#39;ve moved here. I&#39;ve been to the Tustin branch when that first opened and this place is just as great (even better actually).  <br><br>I love the set up and atmosphere of the place. Very modern. <br><br>Our servers were Jen, Calvin, and terry? I highly recommend you ask to be in their area when you come. They were very attentive and approachable. They made sure our requests were completed in a timely manner. Jen especially was great and even had a small conversation with us just to get to know a little more about us. I definitely would come here again and request to be placed in their section if they are working that night. <br><br>Highly suggest coming here asap before things pick up in the next couple of weeks. Have a feeling this place will be crowded soon. However, if you&#39;re looking to drink and eat I suggest you wait till mid January because they are still in the process of getting their liquor license.

Also better meat selections here at Gen for a similar price. <br><br>Food wise I wish I didn&#39;t get so full so fast so I would be able to try the different types of meat they have to offer. Since I&#39;ve been to the Tustin one the food was pretty much similar. I loved it all. Definitely will come back to try some of their other things. <br><br>Management was good. The manager actually came in and checked in on us to make sure everything was going well. I&#39;ve been to many other kbbq places and this is the first time the manager introduced himself to us.

We first went mid-week Wednesday for dinner and were told it was a full house and there&#39;d be a 45 minute wait! We chose to go across the way for Vietnamese instead and came back for dessert. <br><br>We decided to come back today for my husband&#39;s birthday lunch. The food was definitely yummy!  All well marinated and flavorful meats. The atmosphere was hip and modern...club-like. Trendy, fer sure. <br><br>I&#39;m sorry to say, however, that although they&#39;ve been open for 4 weeks...one would think they just opened a week ago. They do not have their act together, yet.   To me, at a well established KBBQ place, you should be continuously grilling then eating or simultaneously grilling and eating. There shouldn&#39;t be an in between 20 minute break where there&#39;s no food to grill or eat.  And it&#39;s poor excuse to tell me the kitchen is backed up. I&#39;m sorry, but if you&#39;re bringing out raw food...where might the hold-up be in the kitchen? <br><br>That in-between-wait was the most annoying thing to me. More so than the fact that they brought us dishes we didn&#39;t order or only brought 2 waters when we asked for 3 ...then had to wave down 3 other servers for the 3rd glass...or forgot to bring us spoons for the soondooboo...then leave us with a peach tea we didn&#39;t ask for, lol. They just slipped it to us! I can&#39;t imagine what the current dinner service is like. <br><br>Yes, I&#39;m still excited for this place and we will come back...but not any time soon. The food is great, the price is fair, and the staff/servers are friendly. Hopefully, 6-8 months from now when the rush dies down and they get their routine on lock, our next experience can be a lot smoother.<br><br>I look forward to when I can update this review.<br><br>...with this new KBBQ place in RC/IE...

I should have expected the service to match the customer service provided by the hostess. She had the nastiest attitude and did not greet us and when she walked us over to the bar seat she slammed the menus, we asked her if we could get a booth and she said that would be a wait which we said was fine. While we were waiting the hostess and her co worker were talking and looking back at us. A wait started to build in the lobby and she never acknowledged us or placed us on the list. She even gave attitude when asked if we could have the booth that opened up. She didn&#39;t call us over even when the other hostess was seating a party that came in after us.<br><br>So we&#39;re finally seated and our server comes over and asks what we&#39;d like to drink so we order and maybe 10 minutes later he comes back to take our food order. It&#39;s 4 of us total and they said we were only allowed a total of 4 food items at a time, we order the first round &amp; it doesn&#39;t take long to arrive. We grill it and we finished our food and drinks and no one has came to check up on us. We flag someone down &amp; we ask for more meat. Again we finish it and no ones checked on us. We have no napkins and no water at this point. We have to flag down again, another person who was NOT our server. At this point it had gotten ridiculous our server had not checked up on us ONCE. He walked past us plenty of times but did not even glance at our table. We also had to flag down an employee to ask for our check. It took a good 20 minutes for them to bring us back our cards and receipt, which was charged incorrectly. We were over it and decided to figure out the money situation between us pals.

So I decided to eat here twice in order to write a review since my first visit was absolutly disappointing, so here is a review based on multiple experiences.<br><br>I&#39;m going to say my first ever experience was HORRIBLE, bad service, bad management! I came in with my wife, a friend and his girlfriend. We were seated and waited a LONG time 20+ minutes until we decided that we likely were forgotten about entirely. So I approached a random guy, told him if he could help us which then explained he wasn&#39;t our waiter but he would find the person to service us, after a few minutes a gentleman comes by and sincerely apologizes and says that he didn&#39;t know he was covering our table and that there was miscommunication on their side. i said no worries, not a problem (thinking things would sail smoothly from there). He asked for the drinks we desired, put them into his ipad, then took our food order which also went into his ipad. He also mentioned due to delay, the sodas were on the house (made me feel good that he sincerely apologized and also threw in the drinks) -- only right thing to do right?<br><br>I also thought the ordering process with advanced technology was neat, first ever KBBQ i seen take orders like that. <br><br>Problem is, our drinks never came... And we asked for three sides of rice and only received two and brought it to one of the waiters attention which then promised to bring it (never did) so my friend and his girlfriend decided to share theirs.<br><br>We get the food, we&#39;re starving and ready to eat and we start cooking. The grill just isn&#39;t hot enough, so i inquired and he said keep the food off the holes and we&#39;ll be good (I told him oh, ok) my bad! But after doing so, I realized this didn&#39;t do much. I was disappointed with how slow things were to cook, but i moved on and tried to keep going. (I also read later via yelp reviews for this location that it&#39;s a known issue as well)<br><br>Anyhow, fast forward we begin eating after some time of the food cooking and I enjoy the taste of the food, no disappointment in taste, but WHERE&#39;S OUR DRINKS? I flag the manager tell him, and he asked what we&#39;d like and that he&#39;d bring them. He never brought them :( Another guy eventually came and asked if we got our drinks, i said no the manager is bringing them. The waiter that inquired said that he&#39;d be taking the order (our third time giving our drink order now) and he luckily followed through and brought them. I assume the first waiter obviously forgot, the manager then grabbed our order but likely forgot what we wanted so sent the third person to inquire and fulfill our drink request. Just wow....<br><br>Throughout our stay, the lack of service, and changing of grills was disappointing. I had to inquire many things from the manager such as changing the grill etc as well as ordering more food due to lack of proper service.<br><br>Fast forward some more, we eventually decided it&#39;d be time to depart so we asked for the check, got it 15 minutes later and instantly provided the credit card and told them to ring us out (no reductions in price aside from the drinks for all the disappointment).... We waited another 20 minutes to get the credit card back and check so we could tip and leave. I still decided to tip $10 when in reality the entire meal for all four should of been on the house, and no tip was necessary. <br><br>NOTE: On my first visit, i noticed their spicy tofu soup was inconsistent, one was edible while the other was not (very oily and spicy, and heavily concentrated) you can see the pics attached to the reviews to see the difference....<br><br>FAST FORWARD to my second visit (today), we arrive and wait ~15 minutes and then are seated and quite instantly are asked about what drinks we want and if we&#39;ve been there before and if we&#39;re ready to order. I said yes :) Service was better this time, food was just as good as my first visit. So I see some positive things which will allow me an opportunity to try it for the third time.<br><br>Overall I am giving them three stars, and i hope i can up the rating during my future visits. From my current experience, all I can say is BAD SERVICE, TASTY GOOD. I hope my future experiences outweigh the first one enough for me to forget about it :P",2/17/2017,3,7,1,0,0,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/95dwbFonxcSvot34X1P9oA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nnkPfA8a079bttPSZmy9-Q/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_H0NULgLf6mmL03wH-JUgQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_XAGnS_ogPpJDdXsEzupgw/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m4oSQQ-Ss9W0Ui9L2BjlUA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H4Vr0b5yKCC4JDs6vXhz4A/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6RZhLafblA-DCjXQs3LdHA/o.jpg,,,

All the meats here had the perfect texture and was not too rough which was a huge plus. They also make your tofu soup and japchae fresh which is why they take longer to get to your table. The downside was the red wine pork belly which tasted a bit funny like Chinese cured pork belly. The service here was quick and attentive and the waiters refilled our banchan and salad constantly throughout our meal.

Gen KBBQ House is like a pretty girl with no personality...nice to look at, amazing to be in, but when it comes down to it not worth your time.<br><br>Came with some of my coworkers on a weekday night for dinner. $20 for AYCE, pretty standard. The wait wasn&#39;t too terrible but sheeeesh standing outside in the cold was a bitch! When we finally got called I had such high expectations for this place, I loved the decor. It has a lounge/clubby vibe to it. But I didn&#39;t come here for the ambiance, so on to the food.<br><br>FOOD: First of all, our waiter told us that some of the meats on the menu weren&#39;t available because they had run out. I almost laughed! This is an AYCE place, and on a weeknight. None of the KBBQ restaurants I&#39;ve frequented have ever told us they were out of anything. With that being said, we ordered some of the meats (you&#39;re allowed to choose 4 at a time, also standard for any KBBQ place) and waited. WOWWW was all I thought when they started dropping off our food. There were 4 of us at the table (and one of my friend&#39;s daughters), and the amount of meat they give you is ridiculously small. If there are 4 adults at a table why don&#39;t you accommodate that amount in the food you bring us? We ran out in like 10 minutes. I mean shit, I&#39;m no pig (most of the time) but ya girl was hungry! I guess they were scared of running out of more meat so they underfed us. Don&#39;t get me wrong the meats were good (maybe &#39;cus I was a little faded but who knows), but it didn&#39;t make up for the amount we were gipped of. The sides they gave were scarce as well. Kimchi was okay, which was sad because that&#39;s my favorite thing everrr.<br><br>SERVICE: Again, nothing special, extremely sub-par. Our waiter was cool but he messed up our drink order twice, and we had to flag down another waiter because he was MIA. Took forever for them to check on us &amp; get our next order, forgot to bring more of whatever sides we asked for, etc. And it wasn&#39;t like we were mean or rude either, all of us are waitresses so we were super nice.<br><br>OVERALL: This place is OKAY. 1 star for the ambiance, 1 star for the food, and 1 more star because of the okay service. Come if you wanna impress a girl who&#39;s never been here/had KBBQ before &amp; you&#39;re trying to get it in. Would I come back? Maybe if someone offered to pay for my meal. Otherwise I&#39;ll make the trip to Rowland Heights or K-Town for my KBBQ fix.",3/7/2015,3,1,3,3,1,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gbDL4vm9_FNmZzSFtGuevA/o.jpg,,,,,,,,,

It was moderately busy, of course it was a Sunday night and around dinner time. One of the people helping us mentioned that they were a bit understaffed and I get it- I&#39;ve worked in restaurants for 5 years being understaffed is stressful and not everything is going to be perfect. I don&#39;t really expect perfect or smiles all around anyway. What I expect to do is to be able to eat. Anything. Something. Throughout the whole time we were there almost 2 hours as we got our check at 7:48. Not one person came to our table and said &#34;hello my name is ---- and I&#39;ll be helping you today&#34; though I saw many tables adjacent to us receive this courtesy. I&#39;ve also included a notated picture of our receipt and we received less than half of what&#39;s tabulated on there, and what made it on there wasn&#39;t even everything we ordered (make it make sense). It was one thing after the other- &#34;the kitchen lost your ticket&#34; &#34;sorry it probably didn&#39;t go through&#34; &#34;we&#39;re really backed up tonight (said in a thoroughly irate tone of voice)&#34; ok!

A few of the plates we got food served to us was broken, and it just felt like there was a lack of quality of service. There was many times that we asked for more ban Chan, or Daikon, but it never came. Also the fact that NO one else would stop to help besides our own server was frustrating.

It joust felt like everyone would do things the lazy way.

We got seated promptly and our server Ryan was friendly and easy to talk to. As we were walking to our table, I noticed that the floor is extremely slippery from possible grease.

So I don&#39;t know what they can do to manage the grease spills throughout the day.<br><br>When we got our food, everything was on point. The only negative was the rice paper. This was my first time ever at any gen where the edges of the rice paper were hard and stale and not soft like the rest of the paper. <br><br>The service from Ryan was initially great. However, as the night went on, Ryan had more tables to wait on in his section which caused him to be less attentive to our table. This isn&#39;t a knock on him, but on management to have less tables that waiters are responsible for. At the end of our meal, the wife wanted a half order of brisket since we were both getting full. We waited close to 15 minutes for that small plate to come out. Ryan came to us about 3 times saying he was going to check on that order. Then we had 2 other staff ask if we were done eating, since we were just sitting there, but told them we were still waiting on another order. They said they will check on our order but still, nothing came out.

Careful when walking because the floors can be slippery. I&#39;ve seen how they change the grills and they don&#39;t hold it over a tray or anything, so the grease drips all over the floor. Management needs to implement on that because if someone falls...On a side note, their chairs are nice though. <br><br>Service: started off wonderfully. Got seated right away. Hostess was informative of the prices and menu items. Waitress introduced herself and got us started right away with the side dishes, drinks, and our first order. As the time progressed, they got more busy and less attentive. Other servers were trying to help each other out, but items were being forgotten, refills had to be asked for instead of keeping it half filled. It almost looked like there weren&#39;t enough servers. They were too busy, I even saw a server running across the hall:/ management should think about the staffing and the number of tables appropriate per server, especially if they want to maintain their customer service at a great consistency. <br><br>Quality of food and price: great price and wide variety to choose from. However, if you&#39;re a brisket lover, the quality on their brisket isn&#39;t so great. It&#39;s too fatty. But their Hawaiian steak and premium steak and beef belly were very good.

I&#39;m so damn happy to finally have one down the street from my house. I went with my bro and son right after work. This place is legit. Even with everyone in training, the food AND service couldn&#39;t have been any better. Shout out to Lawrence, Keanu, Isabelle, Madelene, Nadine, Vince, Haowie, Paul, and Randy.. (sorry if I missed a few) for the spectacular service. Even if it was a hectic 1st Friday night after the restaurant first opened, I could tell that everyone worked together as a team to quickly and efficiently service the customers. I appreciate that I don&#39;t have to wait for &#34;my server&#34; because everyone was able and WILLING to help each other out. I am aware of what exceptional customer service is and they definitely provide that at Gen. By the way, the red wine pork belly, calamari steak, and bulgogi were my faves (all recommended by the staff). ALL the food was delicious actually (great portions) and the staff even helped cook the food so my family and I could really enjoy our time there. I hope the staff keeps up with the excellent service.  Such an awesome vibe as always. Great music (play more 90&#39;s hip hop and r&amp;b! haha :P) and atmosphere for families and young adults especially. They have a very down to earth and easy going staff, but still very attentive. Sorry, but move over Wang Cho! Chino Hills finally has GEN! Gen got it right!<br><br>UPDATE!!!! I came back the next day (yes, I sure did) for lunch with my family. Keanu was our waiter again. He&#39;s an awesome waiter. Madelene and Vince were also sooo super helpful and nice. I just absolutely love the staff here.

We were the first group of people arrived shortly after it was opened. the lunch is $15.99 per person and dinner is $20.99. pretty reasonable price.<br><br>So the lunch menu has fewer items (27 items) than the dinner menu. so the number of side dishes choices are much less than the number of side dishes in the past. only 4 choices. <br><br>Ordered<br>1. Premium Chadol (brisket). the first plate that we got..the meats had a lot of fat and it seems like it was frozen or leftover from last night? b/c when we got the second plate, the color of the meat is much more red and seem more fresh. the meat is alright just like any other brisket that i would get from a Korean bbq place but the meat is really thin and much more fat than other brisket that i had got in the past<br>2. Beef bulgogi: it came in a plate as a big chunk of meat. but when i took a bite into it, it is more like a bunch of marinated ground beef getting mixed together. the texture of beef taste kinda weird. <br>3. Handjungsal(pork check); i would say this is probably the best meat out of all the stuffs we ordered...very chewy and meat is really fresh..(we got small portion of meats vs when we ordered the brisket, they gave us a HUGE plate)..again i am assuming the first brisket plate we got were probably leftover or frozen?<br>4. shrimps: the shrimps are alright..not super fresh..and it is a whole shrimp not the peeled shrimps<br>5. Nook Gan Sal *marinated finger short ribs)...not so good..my husband even said the there is some sourness taste from the meat after it was cooked <br><br>the service is kinda slow and unsure why esp we were literally the only couple that was there..service is not bad but not outstanding...<br><br>Overall impression: the quality of meat is really bad...felt like they want to save money by reducing the cost for its meat..and i noticed in both lunch/dinner menus...the meats that are more tasty and typically cost more DO NOT have the &#34;CHEF recommended&#34;  such as beef tongue, Gen Signature Yangum Gablbi (bone in short ribs). and the one we ordered with CHEF recommended signs next to it is less tasty than the one WITHOUT it..maybe it is personal preference, but i have always thought beef tongue to be one of the best items and was always the reason why i eat all you can eat BBQ..<br><br>anyways, it is a very disappointing experience..i used to name GEN bbq as number one korean bbq ...but this place has failed me ...goodbye Gen bbq...",8/31/2017,2,5,5,1,2,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kXvj6_VhwN22w1IBn1tH5Q/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BH0Q7JjlZxKNQarPb5nIuA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rppC-ah8I7xuwcGOB1ioFA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pbD6rN-Uq0xDJi2DlOO4DQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZzVGcOVL_NwSMPtx5DBqNw/o.jpg,,,,,

It was moderately busy, of course it was a Sunday night and around dinner time. One of the people helping us mentioned that they were a bit understaffed and I get it- I&#39;ve worked in restaurants for 5 years being understaffed is stressful and not everything is going to be perfect. I don&#39;t really expect perfect or smiles all around anyway. What I expect to do is to be able to eat. Anything. Something. Throughout the whole time we were there almost 2 hours as we got our check at 7:48. Not one person came to our table and said &#34;hello my name is ---- and I&#39;ll be helping you today&#34; though I saw many tables adjacent to us receive this courtesy. I&#39;ve also included a notated picture of our receipt and we received less than half of what&#39;s tabulated on there, and what made it on there wasn&#39;t even everything we ordered (make it make sense). It was one thing after the other- &#34;the kitchen lost your ticket&#34; &#34;sorry it probably didn&#39;t go through&#34; &#34;we&#39;re really backed up tonight (said in a thoroughly irate tone of voice)&#34; ok!

A few of the plates we got food served to us was broken, and it just felt like there was a lack of quality of service. There was many times that we asked for more ban Chan, or Daikon, but it never came. Also the fact that NO one else would stop to help besides our own server was frustrating.

We got seated promptly and our server Ryan was friendly and easy to talk to. As we were walking to our table, I noticed that the floor is extremely slippery from possible grease.

So I don&#39;t know what they can do to manage the grease spills throughout the day.<br><br>When we got our food, everything was on point. The only negative was the rice paper. This was my first time ever at any gen where the edges of the rice paper were hard and stale and not soft like the rest of the paper. <br><br>The service from Ryan was initially great. However, as the night went on, Ryan had more tables to wait on in his section which caused him to be less attentive to our table. This isn&#39;t a knock on him, but on management to have less tables that waiters are responsible for. At the end of our meal, the wife wanted a half order of brisket since we were both getting full. We waited close to 15 minutes for that small plate to come out. Ryan came to us about 3 times saying he was going to check on that order. Then we had 2 other staff ask if we were done eating, since we were just sitting there, but told them we were still waiting on another order. They said they will check on our order but still, nothing came out.

Careful when walking because the floors can be slippery. I&#39;ve seen how they change the grills and they don&#39;t hold it over a tray or anything, so the grease drips all over the floor. Management needs to implement on that because if someone falls...On a side note, their chairs are nice though. <br><br>Service: started off wonderfully. Got seated right away. Hostess was informative of the prices and menu items. Waitress introduced herself and got us started right away with the side dishes, drinks, and our first order. As the time progressed, they got more busy and less attentive. Other servers were trying to help each other out, but items were being forgotten, refills had to be asked for instead of keeping it half filled. It almost looked like there weren&#39;t enough servers. They were too busy, I even saw a server running across the hall:/ management should think about the staffing and the number of tables appropriate per server, especially if they want to maintain their customer service at a great consistency. <br><br>Quality of food and price: great price and wide variety to choose from. However, if you&#39;re a brisket lover, the quality on their brisket isn&#39;t so great. It&#39;s too fatty. But their Hawaiian steak and premium steak and beef belly were very good.

I&#39;m so damn happy to finally have one down the street from my house. I went with my bro and son right after work. This place is legit. Even with everyone in training, the food AND service couldn&#39;t have been any better. Shout out to Lawrence, Keanu, Isabelle, Madelene, Nadine, Vince, Haowie, Paul, and Randy.. (sorry if I missed a few) for the spectacular service. Even if it was a hectic 1st Friday night after the restaurant first opened, I could tell that everyone worked together as a team to quickly and efficiently service the customers. I appreciate that I don&#39;t have to wait for &#34;my server&#34; because everyone was able and WILLING to help each other out. I am aware of what exceptional customer service is and they definitely provide that at Gen. By the way, the red wine pork belly, calamari steak, and bulgogi were my faves (all recommended by the staff). ALL the food was delicious actually (great portions) and the staff even helped cook the food so my family and I could really enjoy our time there. I hope the staff keeps up with the excellent service.  Such an awesome vibe as always. Great music (play more 90&#39;s hip hop and r&amp;b! haha :P) and atmosphere for families and young adults especially. They have a very down to earth and easy going staff, but still very attentive. Sorry, but move over Wang Cho! Chino Hills finally has GEN! Gen got it right!<br><br>UPDATE!!!! I came back the next day (yes, I sure did) for lunch with my family. Keanu was our waiter again. He&#39;s an awesome waiter. Madelene and Vince were also sooo super helpful and nice. I just absolutely love the staff here.

We were the first group of people arrived shortly after it was opened. the lunch is $15.99 per person and dinner is $20.99. pretty reasonable price.<br><br>So the lunch menu has fewer items (27 items) than the dinner menu. so the number of side dishes choices are much less than the number of side dishes in the past. only 4 choices. <br><br>Ordered<br>1. Premium Chadol (brisket). the first plate that we got..the meats had a lot of fat and it seems like it was frozen or leftover from last night? b/c when we got the second plate, the color of the meat is much more red and seem more fresh. the meat is alright just like any other brisket that i would get from a Korean bbq place but the meat is really thin and much more fat than other brisket that i had got in the past<br>2. Beef bulgogi: it came in a plate as a big chunk of meat. but when i took a bite into it, it is more like a bunch of marinated ground beef getting mixed together. the texture of beef taste kinda weird. <br>3. Handjungsal(pork check); i would say this is probably the best meat out of all the stuffs we ordered...very chewy and meat is really fresh..(we got small portion of meats vs when we ordered the brisket, they gave us a HUGE plate)..again i am assuming the first brisket plate we got were probably leftover or frozen?<br>4. shrimps: the shrimps are alright..not super fresh..and it is a whole shrimp not the peeled shrimps<br>5. Nook Gan Sal *marinated finger short ribs)...not so good..my husband even said the there is some sourness taste from the meat after it was cooked <br><br>the service is kinda slow and unsure why esp we were literally the only couple that was there..service is not bad but not outstanding...<br><br>Overall impression: the quality of meat is really bad...felt like they want to save money by reducing the cost for its meat..and i noticed in both lunch/dinner menus...the meats that are more tasty and typically cost more DO NOT have the &#34;CHEF recommended&#34;  such as beef tongue, Gen Signature Yangum Gablbi (bone in short ribs). and the one we ordered with CHEF recommended signs next to it is less tasty than the one WITHOUT it..maybe it is personal preference, but i have always thought beef tongue to be one of the best items and was always the reason why i eat all you can eat BBQ..<br><br>anyways, it is a very disappointing experience..i used to name GEN bbq as number one korean bbq ...but this place has failed me ...goodbye Gen bbq...",8/31/2017,2,5,5,1,2,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kXvj6_VhwN22w1IBn1tH5Q/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BH0Q7JjlZxKNQarPb5nIuA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rppC-ah8I7xuwcGOB1ioFA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pbD6rN-Uq0xDJi2DlOO4DQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZzVGcOVL_NwSMPtx5DBqNw/o.jpg,,,,,

Came in with my husband Sunday evening we got there around 12 not to busy no wait time we sit and From the looks of it only one server was on the floor he had about 5 tables including us. We look at the menu and choose what meet what we want and a server brought us salad and ask If we would like rice and that our server would be with us shortly so roughly about 10 mins waiting Our server greets us and takes our order...we order glass noodles, popcorn chicken,brisket,rice cakes, Hawaiian steak which is always our first  round...Food start coming out and we start cooking and start to eat our popcorn chicken and glass noodles to only discover that everything was COLD!!! Was Pretty upset but still ate it we were hungry!!!! But wasn&#39;t sure if We were more upset about cold food or that only half our grill was HOT so cooking the food took even longer... We order more food and get half order of Red Wine pork belly and half order of Cajun chicken and prime steak...while waiting for the reminding of our food to finishing cooking a new server comes to our tables and mumbles something and he starts to flatten our steak with thongs for about 4 mins...my husband and I look at each other and say nothing  ...I don&#39;t know about you but I don&#39;t like a flat prime steak...I do appreciate that he was trying to help I mean he tried not like our server ofcourse... overall service was ok could be better!!! Food not to great food is either COLD or had a weird taste...Will give gen one more try but will prefer to drive to montclair for warm food and better service (even though the robots don&#39;t work most of the time)",9/18/2017,2,1,1,0,0,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MpYjNPUGYpSm0ENHZuZ9XQ/o.jpg,,,,,,,,,

Jabez, Gabriela, Tim were urgent accurate and did not make me feel like an outsider. As a small group of 3 we were sat in the matter of minutes from arriving hardly a wait if you ask me and we had no reservations. Jabez was the first to greet us and take out orders of meat, and it took Gabriela no more than 2 minutes to bring us waters and out first round of meats. Throughout my visit we were treated with smiles, friendly conversation and frequent refills. There was never a void moment which I think is the most important when dinning. From an overall view every server was attentive to each table surrounding ours and they also gather everyone&#39;s attention when it is someone birthday encouraging the whole place to join in on the festive celebration.

We had to wait an hour for both the salad and rice to cook, not to mention, our server wasn&#39;t too friendly nor accommodating. It looked like he was having a bad day. Tip: don&#39;t come here on a weekend and expect good service. Honestly, we felt rushed when ordering. On our second trip, which happened on a weeknight, service and food was WAY better. We had a female server this time and she was very helpful!

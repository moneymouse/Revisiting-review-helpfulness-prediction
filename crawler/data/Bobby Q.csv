Everything was perfect! These chefs really know what they are doing. The chicken was so tender like butter and fried to perfection, so crispy. Not too hard, not too soft it was just right! I loved how the mashed potatoes were made mixed in with the skin, those r my favorite kind. The gravy was incredible and the Mac n cheese OMG! Amazing!! Everything was so hot &amp; fresh.<br><br>Our waiter Harrison was delightful. He was very knowledgeable about the restaurant, menu &amp; how the meats are prepared &amp; cooked. He got our order in &amp; brought it out in a timely fashion, and came back to check on us often. Upon leaving there were about 5 different employees all telling us to have a great night &amp; thanks for coming in. All very eager to wish us well.

Big parking lot and a popular place that attests to its good food. Reservations are on Yelp. We shared a three meat platter but only ordered two meats: Beef rib and double brisket and chose Mac and cheese and beans.  We had their cornbread as a starter and asked for more. The beef rib was soooo good and had a wonderfully rich flavor. The brisket was a good smoky flavor and very tender. Mac and cheese was yummy but the beans were a little crunchy although the flavor was great. I asked to try both the spicy and sweet bbq sauce. Both were good but I like the spicy more!

We started off with the Q rolls, which are rolls stuffed with brisket, and we also had fried zucchini, which was delicious. The zucchini was kind of thin, which I&#39;ve never seen before with fried zucchini. and it came with what looked to be a homemade ranch sauce. <br><br>I also ordered the pineapple drink for my cocktail which was very delicious, and my friends got a Mai Tai and a sangria.<br><br>The restaurant also provides complimentary cornbread and it was fantastic, it was more of like a cornbread cake and it came with butter.

You are allowed to choose one side and they have many to choose from. There was not much sauce on the pulled pork and I thought it was fine but nothing special. The mashed potatoes were very creamy and delicious though. It also came with a pickle. My friends got a half rack of baby back ribs as well as the pulled pork plate, and it looked like she had more sauce on her pulled pork versus my sandwich.<br><br>Waitservice was also good. The reason this place gets four stars for me and not five is because prices are pretty high, my sandwich was $17 and our appetizers were 14 to $15. Plates range from like $23 to $29. The other reason is what I said previously, I feel like a barbecue place should have great barbecue and my sandwich was just okay.<br><br>That being said, everything else we ate here was fantastic so I would return when in town.

I want to first preface by saying that this is not a place you come with a half empty stomach because you would regret not eating more.<br>The secret behind Bobby Q&#39;s barbeque lies within the slow cooking process over Tennessee hickory wood paired with the perfect blend of spices such as the special dry rub .The result is succulent hand-pulled pork, smoky sausage links, fork-tender brisket, and ribs that fall right off the bone. Three different ribs are offered (St. Louis, Texas, and baby back) as well as chicken, salmon, burgers, and hand-cut steaks. The sides are a great accompaniment, but the meat is the show stopper here. I was not a fan of the Mac and cheese but everything else was top-notch. We finished our meal with the ginormous sized Mud pie and couldn&#39;t finish the whole thing even though we really tried. The service was top-notch, and they even gave us a bag of fresh fried donuts, dusted with cinnamon sugar on the house.

That said, Bobby Q has temporarily brought me out of retirement like Floyd Mayweather looking for a quick payday. IMO, any review less than 5 stars for this place is strictly a matter of personal preference or some one-off issue unreflective of the mass experience.  I had:<br><br>3 meat combo w/ baby back ribs, brisket, and smoked sausage. Plus, corn bread, pecan coleslaw, Mac n Cheese, mashed potatoes, and Q Rolls.<br><br>I&#39;m actually a relatively small-portion eater, but sitting outside the restaurant and smelling the blissful bbq aroma, while ordering, was like walking into a pre-COVID Costco on an empty stomach. I found myself wanting to sample everything and leaving with way more than I bargained for. Unlike Costco though, I didn&#39;t wake up the next day with a &#39;what the hell did I just do&#39; hangover (I mean why does everything taste so good at Costco and crappy when I make it?) Getting back on track, I barely put a dent in my order and have now had my original dinner, a microwaved bbq breakfast, and I&#39;m looking forward to lunch with the last of my leftovers.<br><br>Now, I&#39;ve always considered myself more of a Tri Tip person, but... damn, Bobby Q&#39;s brisket was amazing. Basically, if bbq could be sold on a cotton candy stick, Bobby Q&#39;s tender, smoked brisket would be the top seller. The ribs were equally tender, and which one you prefer is likely a matter of preference, but there&#39;s really no point in me trying to convince you either way. Like a debate over the GOAT in basketball, the Kobe, Lebron, Jordan argument is never ending and there&#39;s really no wrong answer. Although, whichever one of three players above you like the least, that&#39;s the smoked sausage. It was good, don&#39;t get me wrong, but it&#39;s smoked sausage competing against brisket and baby backs, what can I say?<br><br>Regarding the sides:<br><br>Cornbread: Good, took it to go so I&#39;m not sure what they offer in-restaurant but some honey butter would&#39;ve taken it over the top.<br><br>Pecan coleslaw: Loved it. No idea why other places don&#39;t do this. If you like coleslaw, you&#39;ll be in heaven.<br><br>Mashed potatoes: Good, but the gravy made them great. I got the gravy on the side, and I&#39;m not sure why, but when I opened it, it smelled like clam chowder to me. I thought I&#39;d got a bonus item somehow. When I couldn&#39;t find the gravy, I circled back to my bonus chowder and realized my error. Regardless, it was bomb.<br><br>Mac n Cheese: Good. Generally par for the course. Although, I have known some places to blow it somehow. This is not one of those places. <br><br>Finally, the Q Rolls: (Insert four letter word here starting with the letter F and ending with u, c, k.) These egg roll looking things stuffed with tender brisket are a game changer. I mean, c&#39;mon, dipped in a special bbq ranch sauce and a light crunch in every bite? It&#39;s stupid really. If heaven doesn&#39;t have this recipe, I&#39;m choosing reincarnation if given the choice. You need to order these!<br><br>Final word: Try it or diet? The suspense is killing you right? <br><br>Definitely Try it! Then try it for breakfast the next day, and one more time for the hell of it. I&#39;m in a hotel with a crappy microwave and it was actually just as good this morning, no lie. Your welcome.

This place is pretty large inside too. <br><br>They have a gorgeous covered patio with really pretty lighting. There&#39;s even a TV on the patio for all of the sports heads.

He was also kind enough to give me some great recommendations as far as hiking and sight seeing in the area. A true gem with heart and personality. <br><br>The drinks are.... wowza! I had their Q-lada which was similar to a piña colada but with strawberry purée and damnit... It was phenomenal! It was almost too pretty to drink. It came garnished with fresh coconut and pineapple and came l served in a HUGE ass glass! Shoutout to the bartender who hooked this drink up because it was FABULOUS! Yes, I was feelin&#39; it.<br><br>And last but not least.... that FOOD!!! Woooooo babyyyy! Those RIBS were the truth! The TRUTH. Period. I ordered their 1/2 rack of baby back ribs w/ mac and cheese and ranch beans. It was delicious!!! The ribs definitely stole the show. They were falling off the bone and were oh so tender.

It was a hit! And those donuts? And even BIGGER hit! That cornbread was so moist and the butter melted as soon as I spread it on the top. It was melting in my mouth! So good! Derrick even gave me some more to-go! Ha! Like I REALLY needed it, but it was so damn delicious.<br><br>I can&#39;t even talk about the donuts now because now I&#39;m craving. They were perfect.

We ordered the *Platter Sampler* since it was a great way to try out their wares. We selected brisket, baby back ribs, and St. Louis style ribs for our meat choices and a mac as our side. Our server asked if we wanted their Original or Spicy BBQ sauces and she obliged when we requested for both. They give you relatively large vats of this sauce, so you basically are smothering everything in it. Otherwise, the baby back ribs were probably the most impressive. Good tender meat with that overcooked, fall-off-the-bone quality. The sauce on the St. Louis ribs wasn&#39;t anything I was accustomed too; a bit astringent and not exactly vinegary. The brisket was pretty boring, dry, and over cooked. Again, the sauce helped greatly to enhance its quality. <br><br>We also sampled a bit of their lunch special for $9.95, the *BLC Sandwich* aka the bacon, lettuce, and CHICKEN. It was a very good deal and the one half we consumed was actually rather tasty; meaty and juicy chicken with a large helping of bacon, lettuce, and sauce. <br><br>Service was fantastic and the outdoor patio was relaxing and comfortable with the cushions, although said cushioning was kind of grody and caked with spilled food. There&#39;s a lot of BBQ in Phoenix and this one is very much well-loved by the locals. Again, not real BBQ in my opinion, but you go for the ambiance... and good deals!",4/1/2019,4,3,4,2,2,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CObputT3rITgLyDab4WTrg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n-mDJrRwTaeX7yCZF3X3UA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ufBZM3z2h2WyFsZkTJtjgA/o.jpg,,,,,,,

We were welcomed by him and asked if we had ever been to a Bobby Q&#39;s to which the answer was no. He gave a quick background about the restaurant chain and how it came about. Advised their angus steaks are aged 60 days and cut in-house and their BBQ meats are smoked for 22hrs (Pretty sure those were the timeframes but I could be wrong). Went over the menu and gave the drink menu. <br><br>Started out with the Cajun Shrimp appetizer <br>-shrimp not over cooked<br>-sautéed in butter cajun seasoning and beer<br>-garlic bread <br>Holy crap this was soooo good!! The shrimp was &#34;juicy&#34; which is not something I would ever describe shrimp as but I&#39;m not quite sure how else to describe it. It was DELICIOUS and not tough or chewy. I&#39;m a sauce fanatic and I literally wanted to drink the sauce out of the dish but didn&#39;t think that was appropriate so I opted to just dip the garlic bread in the sauce <br><br>The cornbread was dense and sweet and didn&#39;t fall apart - yummmmy<br><br>Dinner came out within 10 min, right after the shrimp was finished. I got the pick 2 meats as suggested by Jared because I couldn&#39;t decide between the beef brisket or the pulled pork - and with the pick 2 I got both!!  The pulled pork was my FAVORITE of the 2. It was fall off the fork tender and melted in my mouth. Again since I&#39;m a sucker for good sauce I asked for more BBQ sauce to which Jared brought out both spicy and regular. The spicy wasn&#39;t too spicy at all and had just the perfect amount of &#34;spice&#34;, that was my favorite of the two BBQ sauces.  I dipped my potato in the bbq sauce and even my mac and cheese it was so good I could drink it!<br><br>For my sides I had the loaded baked potato without chives and the mac and cheese. <br>Baked Potato - The skin was baked with salt which is my fav!! <br>I asked for a side of butter since it came with just sour cream, bacon bits and shredded cheese. It was good but just a standard baked tater and since I seem to love extra condiments I personally could have went for more sour cream and cheese but I&#39;m not going to complain. My friend had the ranch baked beans and next time those are what I will get in place of the baked potato. <br><br>Mac n cheese -creamy and thick. Rich in flavor but not too rich - I loved it and will def order again<br><br>Let me tell you how much I loved the music!! It included 80&#39;s pop Deniece Williams-Let&#39;s hear it for the boy, Motown; The Supremes, 80&#39;s rock; Loverboy-Turn me loose, Katrina and the Waves-Walkin on sunshine, Dusty Springfield-Son of a Preacher Man, Wild Child-Play that funky music white boy, Evelyn King-love come down, Queen and the list of awesome music goes on and on!!<br><br>Had a perfect front row view of the 76ers vs Rockets game and all. <br><br>Christy, one of the managers came to check on us about halfway through dinner to make sure everything was great and make sure everything was acceptable <br><br>Lots of drink choices and I couldn&#39;t choose just 1, so I got 3 :-)<br><br>Watermelon cooler with tajín rim - Strong but delicious <br><br>Q-lada -Toasted coconut rim with some type of coconut cream and Pieces of strawberries blended <br>Cannot taste any alcohol in it with the light rum and it was super delicious and refreshing <br><br>Pineapple Passion - Served in a frozen pineapple with a dried pineapple slice and tangerine slice<br>Creamy and strong but delicious - similar to a pina colada<br><br>Between the busser(s) and Jared, the empty plates were cleared promptly <br><br>Dessert, I was so full from shoveling all the delicious eats in my face but, I couldn&#39;t pass up their dessert!!  I got the banana sub zero square with warm caramel drizzle.  It&#39;s frozen banana pudding with a graham cracker walnut cinnamon bottom crust (I think that&#39;s what the crust was, that&#39;s what it tastes like). It was also very good but I could only eat a few bites and opted for a to go box to enjoy later. <br><br>Christy came by after we finished dessert to see how everything was and even got my dessert to go box!<br><br>Never felt rushed at any point throughout dinner/drinks/dessert. <br><br>I didn&#39;t want to leave and felt like I could hangout here all night!! But, after 2 hours I figured I better get my a$$ up so other people can enjoy this place just as much as I did!!<br><br>Just when you think it cannot get any better, our check showed up with a bag of FRESH, HOT donuts fried in peanut oil and covered in cinnamon sugar!!  OMG!

Before my last visit, it had been a solid 10 years since my last time. I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect as I didn&#39;t remember any of it. I was excited to see how good the BBQ was and to support a local place. <br><br>FOOD: We ordered the &#34;Whole Hog&#34; which comes with 2 types of ribs (your choice), 2 types of meat (your choice), and 3 sides (your choice). This sampler platter was $55, but a great trial for three people. The food only took about 15 minutes to be prepared and brought to our table. Holy cow it was a great feast! My personal favorite from that meal was the St. Louis Ribs. Those ribs were cooked to perfection and fell off the bone with amazing flavor. The sausage was also extremely delicious with a hint of spice. The sides we chose were mac &amp; cheese, baked beans, and roasted corn. All of these were exceptional and well worth it. The food alone will have me coming back to try other menu options. <br><br>SERVICE: Our server was Dustin. He was a really nice guy who knew a lot about the menu and how all this great food is prepared. One of the people in my group had a dairy allergy, and Dustin was able to help accommodate us on what we could order.

I&#39;ve only been to the Grand Canyon a few times. This was my first visit to Bobby Q.<br><br>I can&#39;t believe it took me so long. I have sampled their BBQ at events, but this is my first visit to their establishment. So being a native, I grew up going to Bobby McGee&#39;s (one of owner Bob Sikora&#39;s original endeavors here in the Valley). In 2005, he turned his attention to BBQ and opened up Bobby Q. You can smell the meat smoking as you get out of your car in the parking lot. The menu has a variety of meats to choose from like tender brisket, pulled pork, chicken, prime rib, steaks, fish and burgers. The brisket and pork is slow cooked for hours at a low temperature. They smoke their meat with Almond and Mesquite wood and use a nice blend of spices for the dry rub. For BBQ sauce, Bobby Q has both a sweet and spicy Carolina sauce available. They have a variety of sides to choose from for your entree but I highly recommend their cheesy mac &amp; cheese. It&#39;s so gooey and delicious! My sliced-brisket sandwich was amazing and I savored each bite. If you aren&#39;t a meat lover (why would you come here if not?), the Biltmore location has a some vegan dishes and other healthy options on the menu. Bobby Q is known for their famous corn bread that is complimentary if you order something. They are really good (especially with butter on it) and are made fresh daily. Each table also gets a complimentary bag of fresh-made mini doughnuts dipped in cinnamon sugar for the ride home (mine didn&#39;t make it to the car). Overall, prices are very reasonable and portions are large. This was a fun experience and I look forward to future visits. The restaurant can be a little loud at times but it does have a fun community feel to it. In addition to the Biltmore location, Bobby Q also has a location in Mesa.",7/6/2019,5,5,12,8,12,False,True,7/10/2019,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Bar2nmGduDnWTQOTZFz2Ug/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aE9JMj0jYj2cRyhiJenkQA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DfizL5S9pf1FjPrMeoAg1A/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CiRmPYqPvMiG1gC5X_DxsQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xlQFXhu3u_cVDvk5X7Wppw/o.jpg,,,,,

As I was driving my little brother searched up a place to eat and he wanted to try some barbeque. <br><br>We opted to try Bobby Q because another place was closed on Monday, and we thought the name + the numerous reviews was appealing. <br><br>We made a reservation online for 2pm but when we arrived, it wasn&#39;t packed so we were just able to get seated easily for 2. They also have an outdoor patio area where you can sit and enjoy a waterfall, we almost sat there but we decided to let the host sit us wherever was most convenient for them. <br><br>We were sat and asked what we wanted to drink by our waiter Chris(topher). He&#39;s got his greeting and mantra down, &#34;Have you been here before?&#34; <br>Us: No we&#39;re just passing by.<br>Chris: &#34;Where are you all from?&#34; <br>Us: Los Angeles area<br>Chris: &#34;Very cool, I&#39;m from California, San Bernardino myself!&#34;<br><br>I heard this repeated to other customers who sat down. He&#39;s a very personable waiter. <br><br>We wanted to try a variety of things so my brother and I opted for the Whole Hog&#39;s Variety. It was about $54 but we already dented it. It came with a choice of a variety of different things but we chose: sausage, beef brisket, beef ribs, and St. Louis ribs.<br><br>Sausage: I thought it was good but nothing too special. Perhaps I&#39;m just not a fan of sausages done this way, but by no means was it bad. <br><br>Beef brisket: This was probably the star of the dish. It was amazingly delicious. It was very juicy and tender and the sauce didn&#39;t overpower the meat taste. This is something I highly recommend.<br><br>Beef Ribs: I&#39;m a sucker for beef ribs, and these were so good the meat came off the bones easily. The flavor was a little bland but that was perfect, because the sauce provided the needed salt.<br><br>St Louis Pork Ribs: They were also really good and they melted off their bones, but the St. Louis pork ribs were too salty. I was only able to eat 2 because I couldn&#39;t keep eating it, but the flavors were good. <br><br>For the sides we got the: Mac and cheese, corn, and pecan cole slaw.<br><br>I originally wanted more vegetables as a side because vegetables help compliment meat, but my little brother wanted the mac and cheese, and the corn. So I chose the cole slaw as a means to cut the richness of the different barbeque meats. <br><br>The mac and cheese was very rich, and I couldn&#39;t eat too much of it because of how rich both the entree and the side was. <br><br>I was also so-so with the corn, but as a disclaimer, I&#39;m very impartial to corn to begin with. To me, unless it&#39;s naturally very sweet they&#39;re almost wasted calories. This was just a personal preference, but my brother wanted it.<br><br>The pecan cole slaw was perfect. If anything I would have liked a little more acidity in it, but it was such a good addition to the meal. After a bite of the rich pork ribs, the cole slaw really helps cleanse the palette. It was very refreshing. <br><br>Overall we were very pleased by this restaurant. Our bill came out to be about $39 per person (tax and a hefty tip) but we probably had enough food to last 3 meals.",11/26/2018,5,3,5,1,3,False,True,1/1/2019,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K7KJqcorOYYlSWc1jNPghg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U_kL59_DwfIO_uPR5YjbTg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mJFOtEj7NL4QwdWoswGaEA/o.jpg,,,,,,,

We chose the sausage which was super tender and packed with flavor and two different kinds of ribs that were to die for. I asked for some extra sauce and a toasted bun, and Dustin brought the bun with practically a pitcher of BBQ sauce (new best friend). The sides we ordered were the roasted corn, baked beans, and the mac n&#39; cheese. I could only eat the beans which were fantastic, and the other two people loved their sides as well.

The service at this place it top notch and far surpasses that of any 5 star, fine dining establishments I&#39;ve ever been to. I am a firm believer that food may come up short from time to time.

It&#39;s a bummer when that happens but most often people will return to try it again. But... a server is on stage, in front of their guests, until the last curtain call. They really have no room for error without getting scrutinized and skinned alive. And they tend to take the hit for the entire restaurant. If the food is bad, for some reason it&#39;s easier for people to take it out on the server. If it took an hour to get a table, somehow it&#39;s the servers fault.

He was honest about one of them, the Watermelon Cooler, and let me know it&#39;s not for everyone and it gets sent back quite a bit. I ordered it and LOVED it. It tasted like a Jalapeno infused, Watermelon Margarita. I love spicy margaritas and this cocktail was right up my alley! <br>The food was also superb. I had beef ribs as well as 1/2 rack baby backs, accompanied with Mashed Potatoes and Mac N CHeese! <br>PSA: There is absolutely no dainty way to eat the beef ribs. Just accept the facts, get in touch with your inner Caveman, and go to town! Nom, Nom, Nom... while you&#39;re feasting, try to remember you are in public, people may be watching, so keep the growling to a minimum. <br>At the end of our meal, we were so full, we regretfully declined dessert. We did however find a tiny bit of room for the complimentary mini donuts. I actually asked if we could order some to go. To my pleasant surprise, they sell them by the dozen! And, to my ultimate surprise our server brought us a few extra donuts, told us not to leave, and came back with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!! Whhaaaaaaat?? Omg... mind blown and super yummy! All in all Bobby Q. has it together from start to finish and you will not be disappointed! Be sure to ask for Donald, he&#39;s one of the best!",7/19/2018,5,3,4,1,2,False,True,1/4/2019,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WtULIZbcha02ZN9ON6yMKQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U2OTai9WcGYAvUAnp3E5cQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FRa-TfO9tfFZXO3jRE8dxw/o.jpg,,,,,,,

That said, Bobby Q has temporarily brought me out of retirement like Floyd Mayweather looking for a quick payday. IMO, any review less than 5 stars for this place is strictly a matter of personal preference or some one-off issue unreflective of the mass experience.  I had:<br><br>3 meat combo w/ baby back ribs, brisket, and smoked sausage. Plus, corn bread, pecan coleslaw, Mac n Cheese, mashed potatoes, and Q Rolls.<br><br>I&#39;m actually a relatively small-portion eater, but sitting outside the restaurant and smelling the blissful bbq aroma, while ordering, was like walking into a pre-COVID Costco on an empty stomach. I found myself wanting to sample everything and leaving with way more than I bargained for. Unlike Costco though, I didn&#39;t wake up the next day with a &#39;what the hell did I just do&#39; hangover (I mean why does everything taste so good at Costco and crappy when I make it?) Getting back on track, I barely put a dent in my order and have now had my original dinner, a microwaved bbq breakfast, and I&#39;m looking forward to lunch with the last of my leftovers.<br><br>Now, I&#39;ve always considered myself more of a Tri Tip person, but... damn, Bobby Q&#39;s brisket was amazing. Basically, if bbq could be sold on a cotton candy stick, Bobby Q&#39;s tender, smoked brisket would be the top seller. The ribs were equally tender, and which one you prefer is likely a matter of preference, but there&#39;s really no point in me trying to convince you either way. Like a debate over the GOAT in basketball, the Kobe, Lebron, Jordan argument is never ending and there&#39;s really no wrong answer. Although, whichever one of three players above you like the least, that&#39;s the smoked sausage. It was good, don&#39;t get me wrong, but it&#39;s smoked sausage competing against brisket and baby backs, what can I say?<br><br>Regarding the sides:<br><br>Cornbread: Good, took it to go so I&#39;m not sure what they offer in-restaurant but some honey butter would&#39;ve taken it over the top.<br><br>Pecan coleslaw: Loved it. No idea why other places don&#39;t do this. If you like coleslaw, you&#39;ll be in heaven.<br><br>Mashed potatoes: Good, but the gravy made them great. I got the gravy on the side, and I&#39;m not sure why, but when I opened it, it smelled like clam chowder to me. I thought I&#39;d got a bonus item somehow. When I couldn&#39;t find the gravy, I circled back to my bonus chowder and realized my error. Regardless, it was bomb.<br><br>Mac n Cheese: Good. Generally par for the course. Although, I have known some places to blow it somehow. This is not one of those places. <br><br>Finally, the Q Rolls: (Insert four letter word here starting with the letter F and ending with u, c, k.) These egg roll looking things stuffed with tender brisket are a game changer. I mean, c&#39;mon, dipped in a special bbq ranch sauce and a light crunch in every bite? It&#39;s stupid really. If heaven doesn&#39;t have this recipe, I&#39;m choosing reincarnation if given the choice. You need to order these!<br><br>Final word: Try it or diet? The suspense is killing you right? <br><br>Definitely Try it! Then try it for breakfast the next day, and one more time for the hell of it. I&#39;m in a hotel with a crappy microwave and it was actually just as good this morning, no lie. Your welcome.

Plus complimentary corn bread to start off the meal! They also usually have complimentary mini doughnuts to end the meal, but unfortunately the fryer wasn&#39;t turned on before opening when we arrived and it wasn&#39;t hot enough by the time we were ready to leave... so the fact that I had declined the second helping of corn bread (which came with our platter) all so I could save room for the doughnuts was not well planned out. <br><br>In any case, again... the BBQ was rather run-of-the-mill and perhaps some items were overcooked, but they&#39;re all about their sauce here. We ordered the *Platter Sampler* since it was a great way to try out their wares. We selected brisket, baby back ribs, and St. Louis style ribs for our meat choices and a mac as our side. Our server asked if we wanted their Original or Spicy BBQ sauces and she obliged when we requested for both. They give you relatively large vats of this sauce, so you basically are smothering everything in it. Otherwise, the baby back ribs were probably the most impressive. Good tender meat with that overcooked, fall-off-the-bone quality. The sauce on the St. Louis ribs wasn&#39;t anything I was accustomed too; a bit astringent and not exactly vinegary. The brisket was pretty boring, dry, and over cooked. Again, the sauce helped greatly to enhance its quality. <br><br>We also sampled a bit of their lunch special for $9.95, the *BLC Sandwich* aka the bacon, lettuce, and CHICKEN. It was a very good deal and the one half we consumed was actually rather tasty; meaty and juicy chicken with a large helping of bacon, lettuce, and sauce. <br><br>Service was fantastic and the outdoor patio was relaxing and comfortable with the cushions, although said cushioning was kind of grody and caked with spilled food.

We were welcomed by him and asked if we had ever been to a Bobby Q&#39;s to which the answer was no. He gave a quick background about the restaurant chain and how it came about. Advised their angus steaks are aged 60 days and cut in-house and their BBQ meats are smoked for 22hrs (Pretty sure those were the timeframes but I could be wrong). Went over the menu and gave the drink menu. <br><br>Started out with the Cajun Shrimp appetizer <br>-shrimp not over cooked<br>-sautéed in butter cajun seasoning and beer<br>-garlic bread <br>Holy crap this was soooo good!! The shrimp was &#34;juicy&#34; which is not something I would ever describe shrimp as but I&#39;m not quite sure how else to describe it. It was DELICIOUS and not tough or chewy. I&#39;m a sauce fanatic and I literally wanted to drink the sauce out of the dish but didn&#39;t think that was appropriate so I opted to just dip the garlic bread in the sauce <br><br>The cornbread was dense and sweet and didn&#39;t fall apart - yummmmy<br><br>Dinner came out within 10 min, right after the shrimp was finished. I got the pick 2 meats as suggested by Jared because I couldn&#39;t decide between the beef brisket or the pulled pork - and with the pick 2 I got both!!  The pulled pork was my FAVORITE of the 2. It was fall off the fork tender and melted in my mouth. Again since I&#39;m a sucker for good sauce I asked for more BBQ sauce to which Jared brought out both spicy and regular. The spicy wasn&#39;t too spicy at all and had just the perfect amount of &#34;spice&#34;, that was my favorite of the two BBQ sauces.  I dipped my potato in the bbq sauce and even my mac and cheese it was so good I could drink it!<br><br>For my sides I had the loaded baked potato without chives and the mac and cheese. <br>Baked Potato - The skin was baked with salt which is my fav!! <br>I asked for a side of butter since it came with just sour cream, bacon bits and shredded cheese. It was good but just a standard baked tater and since I seem to love extra condiments I personally could have went for more sour cream and cheese but I&#39;m not going to complain. My friend had the ranch baked beans and next time those are what I will get in place of the baked potato. <br><br>Mac n cheese -creamy and thick. Rich in flavor but not too rich - I loved it and will def order again<br><br>Let me tell you how much I loved the music!!

Before my last visit, it had been a solid 10 years since my last time. I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect as I didn&#39;t remember any of it.

This sampler platter was $55, but a great trial for three people. The food only took about 15 minutes to be prepared and brought to our table. Holy cow it was a great feast! My personal favorite from that meal was the St. Louis Ribs. Those ribs were cooked to perfection and fell off the bone with amazing flavor. The sausage was also extremely delicious with a hint of spice. The sides we chose were mac &amp; cheese, baked beans, and roasted corn. All of these were exceptional and well worth it. The food alone will have me coming back to try other menu options. <br><br>SERVICE: Our server was Dustin. He was a really nice guy who knew a lot about the menu and how all this great food is prepared.

I&#39;ve only been to the Grand Canyon a few times. This was my first visit to Bobby Q.<br><br>I can&#39;t believe it took me so long. I have sampled their BBQ at events, but this is my first visit to their establishment. So being a native, I grew up going to Bobby McGee&#39;s (one of owner Bob Sikora&#39;s original endeavors here in the Valley). In 2005, he turned his attention to BBQ and opened up Bobby Q. You can smell the meat smoking as you get out of your car in the parking lot. The menu has a variety of meats to choose from like tender brisket, pulled pork, chicken, prime rib, steaks, fish and burgers. The brisket and pork is slow cooked for hours at a low temperature. They smoke their meat with Almond and Mesquite wood and use a nice blend of spices for the dry rub. For BBQ sauce, Bobby Q has both a sweet and spicy Carolina sauce available. They have a variety of sides to choose from for your entree but I highly recommend their cheesy mac &amp; cheese. It&#39;s so gooey and delicious! My sliced-brisket sandwich was amazing and I savored each bite. If you aren&#39;t a meat lover (why would you come here if not?), the Biltmore location has a some vegan dishes and other healthy options on the menu. Bobby Q is known for their famous corn bread that is complimentary if you order something. They are really good (especially with butter on it) and are made fresh daily. Each table also gets a complimentary bag of fresh-made mini doughnuts dipped in cinnamon sugar for the ride home (mine didn&#39;t make it to the car). Overall, prices are very reasonable and portions are large. This was a fun experience and I look forward to future visits. The restaurant can be a little loud at times but it does have a fun community feel to it.

As I was driving my little brother searched up a place to eat and he wanted to try some barbeque. <br><br>We opted to try Bobby Q because another place was closed on Monday, and we thought the name + the numerous reviews was appealing. <br><br>We made a reservation online for 2pm but when we arrived, it wasn&#39;t packed so we were just able to get seated easily for 2. They also have an outdoor patio area where you can sit and enjoy a waterfall, we almost sat there but we decided to let the host sit us wherever was most convenient for them. <br><br>We were sat and asked what we wanted to drink by our waiter Chris(topher). He&#39;s got his greeting and mantra down, &#34;Have you been here before?&#34; <br>Us: No we&#39;re just passing by.<br>Chris: &#34;Where are you all from?&#34; <br>Us: Los Angeles area<br>Chris: &#34;Very cool, I&#39;m from California, San Bernardino myself!&#34;<br><br>I heard this repeated to other customers who sat down. He&#39;s a very personable waiter. <br><br>We wanted to try a variety of things so my brother and I opted for the Whole Hog&#39;s Variety. It was about $54 but we already dented it. It came with a choice of a variety of different things but we chose: sausage, beef brisket, beef ribs, and St. Louis ribs.<br><br>Sausage: I thought it was good but nothing too special. Perhaps I&#39;m just not a fan of sausages done this way, but by no means was it bad. <br><br>Beef brisket: This was probably the star of the dish. It was amazingly delicious. It was very juicy and tender and the sauce didn&#39;t overpower the meat taste. This is something I highly recommend.<br><br>Beef Ribs: I&#39;m a sucker for beef ribs, and these were so good the meat came off the bones easily. The flavor was a little bland but that was perfect, because the sauce provided the needed salt.<br><br>St Louis Pork Ribs: They were also really good and they melted off their bones, but the St. Louis pork ribs were too salty. I was only able to eat 2 because I couldn&#39;t keep eating it, but the flavors were good. <br><br>For the sides we got the: Mac and cheese, corn, and pecan cole slaw.<br><br>I originally wanted more vegetables as a side because vegetables help compliment meat, but my little brother wanted the mac and cheese, and the corn. So I chose the cole slaw as a means to cut the richness of the different barbeque meats. <br><br>The mac and cheese was very rich, and I couldn&#39;t eat too much of it because of how rich both the entree and the side was. <br><br>I was also so-so with the corn, but as a disclaimer, I&#39;m very impartial to corn to begin with. To me, unless it&#39;s naturally very sweet they&#39;re almost wasted calories. This was just a personal preference, but my brother wanted it.<br><br>The pecan cole slaw was perfect. If anything I would have liked a little more acidity in it, but it was such a good addition to the meal. After a bite of the rich pork ribs, the cole slaw really helps cleanse the palette. It was very refreshing. <br><br>Overall we were very pleased by this restaurant. Our bill came out to be about $39 per person (tax and a hefty tip) but we probably had enough food to last 3 meals.",11/26/2018,5,3,5,1,3,False,True,1/1/2019,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K7KJqcorOYYlSWc1jNPghg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U_kL59_DwfIO_uPR5YjbTg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mJFOtEj7NL4QwdWoswGaEA/o.jpg,,,,,,,

I asked for some extra sauce and a toasted bun, and Dustin brought the bun with practically a pitcher of BBQ sauce (new best friend). The sides we ordered were the roasted corn, baked beans, and the mac n&#39; cheese. I could only eat the beans which were fantastic, and the other two people loved their sides as well.

Initially, we had a minor situation with the menus each having different prices. The manager was very gracious and offered us the lower-priced menu.  Very professional and very friendly. <br>LeeAnne was our server and she was a 10.  ‼‼My girlfriend ordered a steak sandwich. The steak was grilled to perfection with a glazed caramelized sauce that brought out the steak&#39;s flavors. It was thick and juicy and so flavorful covered in grilled mushrooms served with onion rings so tasty I ordered one to go.<br>Their potato soup is almost a meal in itself. It is so flavorful with cheese and bacon and chopped onions and potatoes I could&#39;ve eaten another bowl instead I got one to go.<br>Bobby Qs gives you a small bag of homemade donuts to thank you for enjoying their restaurant. Give it a try for sure. <br>Second review:  treated friends today to Bobby Qs for burgers and steak sandwiches. Kyle served us and he was beyond on top of keeping us satisfied. Actually I was the one who got treated today.  Manager Taylor himself took care of a minor problem I had with my steak. He solved the issue as fast as humanly possible.  He gave me the BEST customer service ever in any restaurant I&#39;ve eaten. Food so wonderful; service the same. <br>Third review: my girlfriend took me to barbecue yesterday for my birthday. We wanted to go out in odd times so it would be so crowded and noisy. There are special was a prime rib sandwich with one of their yummy sides and by the time we got there it was sold out. We split a brisket and pork sandwich with a loaded potato and I have enough for dinner. The barbecue sauce is divine.

We went on a Friday night and the wait for a table was about an hour and a half. This was a little bit longer than expected, however we figured we would grab a drink and wait. After seeing how large the drinks were that others around us had ordered, we decided on just one cocktail called Shipwrecked. It was large and pretty sweet with a blue raspberry-coconut flavor. Since this was the type of fruity drink I typically gravitate towards, I was satisfied and would get it again.<br><br>Their estimate on the wait time was fairly accurate so about an hour &amp; a half later, we were seated at a table on their outside patio. Our waiter was friendly and came by our table immediately. He went over the menu items and suggested some of the meat plates and sides. I ended up getting a Pulled BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side of Mac &amp; Cheese (which multiple servers seemed to be recommending) and my fiancé got a three meat plate with the baked potato and mashed potatoes. While we waited, we were brought out some warm cornbread and butter to enjoy, and a short while later, our food arrived.<br><br>After tasting a little bit of everything that we got, I wish I would have ordered one of the red meats instead of the chicken sandwich only because it was so plain compared to the other items. I&#39;m not a huge fan of red meat which I was pleased to see chicken on the menu, but the red meat had the actual BBQ flavor I was hoping to find. All the side items were good; I personally liked the mashed potatoes the most but my fiancé liked the mac and cheese the most.

I don&#39;t know who runs this place or the other, but I&#39;d LOVE to meet him/her or them. The service at this place it top notch and far surpasses that of any 5 star, fine dining establishments I&#39;ve ever been to. I am a firm believer that food may come up short from time to time. Maybe a recipe wasn&#39;t followed. Maybe there&#39;s a new cook in the kitchen. Maybe they are so slammed the kitchen cant keep up, etc.. It&#39;s a bummer when that happens but most often people will return to try it again. But... a server is on stage, in front of their guests, until the last curtain call. They really have no room for error without getting scrutinized and skinned alive. And they tend to take the hit for the entire restaurant. If the food is bad, for some reason it&#39;s easier for people to take it out on the server. If it took an hour to get a table, somehow it&#39;s the servers fault. If an entree was missed and didn&#39;t make it out to the table...yep it&#39;s the server&#39;s fault. Am I wrong? <br>Well here is where I&#39;m going with this. The service at Bobby Q is so cream of the crop, that  in the unfortunate event of any one of the above mentioned scenarios, I can&#39;t foresee it ever being an issue. <br>Our server Donald, was more than just an order taker. He was a true experience maker, and we had the best time with him. I asked him about a couple of cocktails I was torn on. He was honest about one of them, the Watermelon Cooler, and let me know it&#39;s not for everyone and it gets sent back quite a bit. I ordered it and LOVED it. It tasted like a Jalapeno infused, Watermelon Margarita. I love spicy margaritas and this cocktail was right up my alley! <br>The food was also superb. I had beef ribs as well as 1/2 rack baby backs, accompanied with Mashed Potatoes and Mac N CHeese! <br>PSA: There is absolutely no dainty way to eat the beef ribs. Just accept the facts, get in touch with your inner Caveman, and go to town! Nom, Nom, Nom... while you&#39;re feasting, try to remember you are in public, people may be watching, so keep the growling to a minimum. <br>At the end of our meal, we were so full, we regretfully declined dessert. We did however find a tiny bit of room for the complimentary mini donuts. I actually asked if we could order some to go. To my pleasant surprise, they sell them by the dozen! And, to my ultimate surprise our server brought us a few extra donuts, told us not to leave, and came back with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!! Whhaaaaaaat?? Omg... mind blown and super yummy! All in all Bobby Q. has it together from start to finish and you will not be disappointed!

We were very pleased with all the meats we sampled and the Yelp rating didn&#39;t let us down.<br><br>We had about a fifteen minute wait after we checked in at the host stand just after 8. The waiting areas were crowded and many people were waiting outside. I think a buzzer/text system would save some young ladies&#39; voices and annoyance of the guests because when a table became available, the hostesses would yell out the name of the party at the top of their lungs while walking through waiting area.<br><br>We were served by Hunter and he did an excellent job of handling being triple sat with a total of 12 guests by treating the multiple tables as he should and serving all of us as one party of 12. He gave us a brief background of the restaurant also informing us that all the meat is smoked for over 20 hours using mesquite wood. The recommendations for food and beverage were solid. During the meal, my daughter did drop her fork on the ground and we requested on three different occasions for a new one and it was never brought to us.<br><br>For drink, I started with the Bobby Q&#39;s amber ale by Thunder Canyon Brewery which the caramel and malty flavor was an excellent pairing with the barbecue. Along with the warm cornbread to start, we were recommended the Q-Rolls ($10.50) which were a great preview of the meats to come ahead. The brisket was tender and moist wrapped in a crispy shell with a little kick added with a chipotle dip.<br><br>For entrees, my wife and I split the Whole Hog Heaven ($48) which was way too much food for two. All four of us could have split this meal. They were out of sausage that night so we went with the pork to go along with the baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs, and brisket.

Then our order of the Whole Hog Heaven and a rack of the St. Louis Style Ribs came. That was the perfect amount for our group of 6 adults. We only had 2 ribs left and everyone was stuffed!

Bobby Q is basically a textbook example of how to successfully run a restaurant properly.    <br><br>Bobby&#39;s claims it was voted the Best BBQ in the US, although I&#39;m not sure of their source? Nevertheless, I&#39;d have a hard time arguing, as it definitely sets the bar extremely high. We&#39;ve been here several times and have never had a bad meal. In fact, virtually everything we&#39;ve tried on the menu seems to be done correctly. <br><br>The pulled pork, which is my preferred way to eat BBQ, always manages to impress me with its flavor. For sides, I&#39;ve had the mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese, which is far superior to that low-grade sludge they try to get away with dishing out at all of these other places in Phoenix. Even their fries are better than you&#39;d expect.<br><br>The place is decorated to the point where, if I didn&#39;t know any better, I would have wrongfully assumed it was a chain restaurant. But yet, I like that, despite their popularity, they haven&#39;t decided to branch out and open up 20 different locations all over the city (and I actually hope they never do for quality and consistency purposes).<br><br>I&#39;ve always wondered if their steaks are equally as good as their BBQ, but I&#39;ve never wanted to sacrifice the taste of a great pulled pork sandwich in order to find out. And we&#39;re always so full after our meals that we&#39;ve never been able to try some of their desserts. Based on their Yelp pictures, it seems like many people are in the same boat.<br><br>But, like all business owners should know, it&#39;s the little things that go a long way. The complimentary cornbread you receive before your meal is both unique, yet extremely well done. Oh, and that&#39;s not all. On your way out, you also get treated to a little bag of their homemade donuts, which you can often spot being made whenever you first walk in. I&#39;ve said many times that it&#39;s little touches like that keep customers coming back - and it most definitely works.

We knew we could get good food and enjoy a setting that was colorful, eclectic, and maybe even charming in its own special way... if that&#39;s not too far-fetched..all at the same time. Once I moved onto college, and others went their separate ways, we all forgot about Bobby McGee&#39;s. It would often be a topic that would arise at a dinner convo, &#34;What ever happened to that one place we used to go to near 27th Avenue and Northern?&#34; But that was all that ever materialized.<br><br>Luckily, I was reunited with this restaurant, now known as Bobby-Q&#39;s. It has since transitioned into a Kansas City/Texas mixture type barbecue, but still a great atmosphere! After a long day of rock climbing, my friends and I were famished and they suggested getting barbecue. Once we arrived, all the memories started flooding back of this place, and I love what it&#39;s become. The barbecue is really good! It&#39;s actually one of my favorites, I&#39;m surprised to say. Three of us shared the Whole Hog Heaven, which is a major platter where you can choose 2 ribs, 2 meats, and 3 sides. Our selections: the Baby Back ribs, the beef ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, potato salad, macaroni and cheese, and grilled veggies. The rib meat was tender and &#34;fall off the bone&#34; type texture. The  baby back ribs were by far my favorite of the bunch. <br><br>While waiting for our order, our group also shared the smoked brisket Q-rolls with chipotle dip. These were really delicious but kind of reminded me of eating a mini chimi since the phylo dough was so flaky and crispy. There was a small heap of roasted corn served on the plate as well that was super smoky in flavor. <br><br>Even though it is the middle of winter, the patio was still very comfortable since all the heaters overhead were on. There is a metal waterfall sculpture that extends the entire length of the patio so it is very soothing and entertaining to have the sound of &#34;rain&#34; behind you as you&#39;re eating outside.

Not only was it very tender but it was not at all dried out like so many other places that I have tried.

I have never been here when it&#39;s not busy. There is typically a wait, but usually not for the bar.

Right behind the Hostess stand, you will notice a few of the girls making fresh, home-made, cinnamon and sugar covered donuts. They place them in cute little paper bags and they come with every meal.

Trust me. <br><br>But let&#39;s start at the beginning shall we?

The Chicken with its smoky, smothered in BBQ Goodness its juicy and tender. We have had the ribs, the pulled pork, and the sausage. Pretty much anything under the Platters section of the menu... we have had it, and I have yet to leave feeling unsatisfied. As far as sides go...

I&#39;ve been jonesing all week to come check it out, but I figured I&#39;d wait until my wife got into town. Well, I finally got my chance and I was giddy as a school girl. I was actually able to make a reservation through OpenTable on the Yelp app, and I&#39;m sure glad we did. Upon our arrival at 5:30 the place was already packed, but by thetime we left at 7 there was a hoard of people flooding out into the street--and for good reason! Enough jibber-jabber--on to the food! I ordered the Three Meat Combo and that comes with two sides and some of BQ&#39;s Cornbread.<br><br>Sides:<br><br>Mac and Cheese- This might easily be the creamiest, most decadent Mac &amp; Cheese I&#39;ve ever had. They use something similar to Velveeta Cheese to coat it, and I&#39;m not slamming Velveeta. It&#39;s so rich I couldn&#39;t finish it. 3.75*<br><br>Pecan Coleslaw- I&#39;m very picky about my slaw; I don&#39;t want it too creamy, sweet, or bitter and this was absolutely perfect! I also loved the crunch you get from the little pieces of toasted Pecan they add to the top--I&#39;m definitely adding that to my slaw the next time I make it. 5*<br><br>Cornbread- Excellent mix of a Northern/Southern cornbread--it has the cakiness and slight sweetness if Northern, and the crust and stone-ground corn like a Southern; I could eat these everyday. 5* <br><br>Meat:<br><br>St. Louis Ribs- These might be the best St. Louis Pork Ribs (other than mine) that I&#39;ve ever had! The meat had a nice &#34;tug&#34; to it, but was still so tender, smokey and delicious! 5*<br><br>Beef Brisket- Juicy and flavorful this brisket was quite good--my only gripe is I wish it had a bit more smokiness to it. 4*<br><br>Pulled Pork- Another excellent job by BQ! Juicy, smoky and porky (just like me!) Everything you could want in Pulled Pork and then some. I piggled (sic) the whole lot of it! 5*<br><br>Dessert:<br><br>Sugar-Cinnamon Donuts- They give everyone at the table these tiny little donuts that they make fresh up front and they&#39;re fabulous; they had me at &#34;Cinnamon&#34;. I guess you can just walk in and order a dozen for $3 if that&#39;s all your craving, too. 5*<br><br>Service &amp; Ambiance- Good service from our server, Jessica. She was on top of things without being annoying. BQ is located in a building that looks like something you&#39;d find in the middle of nowhere. The interior is mostly brick and wood causing the noise level in there to be deafening by the end of the night. They also keep it a bit too dark for my liking, but the decor is swell. 4*-service/3.5*-Ambiance<br><br>Value- The meals here are not a bad value, as my Three Meat Combo cost $22, but it&#39;s more than enough food for 2 people. Even my piggy self couldn&#39;t finish it--but guess what&#39;s for breakfast?! Snooch to the Nooch! 4*<br><br>I&#39;m about to make a bold proclamation: I think BQ has *the* best BBQ I&#39;ve ever had. I don&#39;t make that statement lightly either--after all, I have a reputation to uphold. I think this was easily the best meal I&#39;ve had here in AZ, and that&#39;s saying something. I can&#39;t wait for my next visit to the Valley of the Sun so I can visit BQ again. If you ever find yourself in Phoenix, I highly, highly recommend making your way here--just make sure to make a reservation!",3/30/2014,5,10,15,11,14,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KOb3W7kSTqICnXQ-aqTYeg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SoLxlpHT0zVYKk28GWIV5g/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Jsq6j9uEQbhIgdjjJDAVNg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f2Lu19OUai9gGg1d5vbf0Q/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w9c8L1ws1YI1RXtObQwzXA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8uGxOPlUtp36_fdansIJDw/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ayu0Ws6vB3aUoaRbxTR7Wg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QXUqI7UZ_lxTixRq1aswfA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Wk489UiH3TyooTJBCX6crw/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WraydvmZhtzYDZjDJCM5oQ/o.jpg

We came by in the early afternoon on a beautiful Saturday and there was zero wait which is perfect because we were starving. We had the choice of sitting outdoors or indoors but chose the latter because not only was it warm out but I saw customers sitting outside swatting flying bugs.<br><br>We ordered the whole hog heaven which is a platter where you choose two ribs, two meats, and three sides for $48. With the help of our waitress we decided to go with the baby backs and beef ribs, brisket and sausage for the meats, and the mac &amp; cheese, ranch beans, and the shoestring fries for the sides. While we were waiting, we received complimentary cornbread. Moist, fluffy, buttery, and semi-sweet... these cornbreads were the best I&#39;ve ever had! I&#39;m sure they are SO bad for your health though but I could only live in the moment!<br><br>- Baby back ribs: May sound like a boring choice but nope. These were smoked to perfection and the meat fell off the bone. I was very impressed.<br>- Beef ribs: If I had to pick a favorite meat of the meal, the beef ribs would be it. These are finger-licking good with loads of meat, and even some bone marrow too. Just divine. Absolutely to die for. LOVE!<br>- Brisket: The first bite I had of the fatty brisket sent me to meat heaven. Succulent and explosive in taste. The leaner parts of the brisket was a touch dry and needed some extra barbecue sauce to fix that though.<br>- Sausage: Robust in flavor with a nice peppery kick.<br>- Mac &amp; cheese: I&#39;m not usually a fan of mac &amp; cheese but these are great. I ate spoonfuls after spoonfuls. <br>- Ranch beans: Smoky and savory. Love these beans. Again, best I&#39;ve had. My favorite of the three sides!<br>- Shoestring fries: I&#39;m generally prefer thick-cut fries but these were an exception. Impeccably fried and perfectly salted, these were very tasty and fun to pick at. Simple yet awesome.<br><br>After our incredibly satisfying feast (yes, we had leftovers for the next day!), we were given freshly fried cinnamon sugar doughnuts on our way out. They were amazing!

It has a rustic look with upscale charm. I sat on the patio and was nervous the noise of the expressway would annoy me. That exact opposite happened. The fountain with the trickling water and the ebb and flow of cars combined to make me feel peaceful and relaxed. The place is incredibly clean as well. <br><br>For the meal itself I ordered Q-rolls to start. These were like beef brisket meeting an egg roll.  It was served with a chipotle sauce and bbq sauce. It was easy to eat and very tasty. The crispy dough outer shell complimented the flavor in the beef. <br><br>For dinner i ordered the 2 choice option. Beef brisket, of course, and the baby back ribs because sever said they&#39;d be one of the best i would ever had.   To be honest, i have had better beef brisket in Tennessee. By all means it was excellent but a tad dry compared to some of the juicy fatty brisket from those hillybilly towns off the  main roads. The server did not lie about the baby back ribs. My grandmother&#39;s ribs compete with these and that says a lot to the quality and taste. WOW!!!!!!  Wonderful!!!!!  I also ordered the ranch baked beans. Very flavorful. It has beef and pork in them. Some of the meat was stringy so texture was odd but flavor is great. <br><br>As for the service.....OUTSTANDING!!!!!  Hunter was my server and his knowledge of the menu and ability to give tips enhanced my experience. He was friendly and had just the right amount of chattiness. The manager, Cameron, was also extremely attentive. I felt like i was in the fine dining section of a cruise ship. They both teamed up to make sure everything was perfect throughout the night. <br><br>I look forward to returning here to try more of their fabulous menu items!!!!<br><br>Ps.

The donuts were soft, warm, and perfectly fried. After the donuts, we decided on the Whole Hog, which was quite a lot of food for three girls. The whole hog came with St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, three sides (which we ordered shoe string fries, mashed potatoes, and corn), BBQ chicken, and brisket, as well as cornbread. The cornbread was buttery and delicious, and it tasted great with the whipped butter. The bbq was honestly the best I have yet to have! The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, and the meat had a good fat-to-meat ratio. Of the meats, my favorite was the smokey St. Louis ribs, which were less saucy and contained chewy tendons (if you&#39;re into that like I am). The mashed potatoes was also super buttery and smooth, and tasted almost like a dip. Also, the waitress brought two pitchers of BBQ sauce, one spicy and one original, so be prepared to drench all the meat in even more sauce. <br><br>After the meal, the waitress was super kind and brought us another round of donuts! <br><br>I would highly recommend this place if you&#39;re in Phoenix!

Filled and rolled with smoked beef brisket and then deep-fried to a golden brown, these looked better than they tasted. The roll&#39;s open ends allowed for far too much oil to penetrate the meaty interior, which ended up a tasteless crunch.<br><br>A steakhouse classic, the Wedge Salad ($5), is made with a quarter of crisp head lettuce, sprinkled with smoked bacon, chopped tomatoes and bleu cheese crumbles.

The restaurant had me at the name but it didn&#39;t hurt that they made Yelps 100 places to eat list. What does one do when they find themselves in Phoenix for the first time ever? Head over to Bobbie Q, of course. I came here for one reason and one reason only. Baby back ribs. I do love my baby backs. There is a pretty large parking lot to fit all the hungry BBQ lovers in one place. As I walked in and smelled the smoky goodness, the hostess in the front handed my party of three a bag of freshly made cinnamon sugar donuts while we waited a few short minutes for a table. Like a child who&#39;s been offered desert before dinner, I gleefully followed the hostess to our table whilst munching on my sugary donuts. Our waiter took our drink orders and I decided on the baby backs with a side of potato salad and mac and cheese. <br><br>After what seemed like a forever of eyeing and sniffing my neighbors meals, our plates came out. The full rack of baby backs were huge. The photo does not do it justice. Talk about a bang for your buck! They smelled amazing as the smokey aroma filled my lungs. I went in with my knife and realized how easy the cut was. There is hours of love put into these ribs because the first bite just melted in my mouth. The best thing about these ribs...they are not overly sauced. You can ask for extra BBQ and add as needed, but the meat is not masked with sauce. I got through about half of the tender rack of ribs before I realized that I still had two bowls piled high with mac and cheese and potato salad. I used the complimentary corn bread with butter to create potato salad and mac and cheese sammies and inhaled my sides. The mac and cheese was so creamy with a distinct sharp cheddar flavor. I wish that the cheese was a little more gooey than creamy, but the flavors where there. The potato salad had good flavor and great textures. It paired really well with the sweet cornbread. Heads up, this place won&#39;t do you well if you are on the diet. This is one cheat meal you will not regret. <br><br>The service was pretty impressive. Our waiter gave suggestions and replaced our drinks with new ones before we finished the original. Our food was served hot and when we were tipping over from being too full, he brought out to go boxes to pile our leftovers in. One of the managers was walking around in the restaurant and checking on tables throughout our meal. We gave kudos to the chef when he asked us about our experience.

I&#39;ve been here one or two times before but for whatever reason was never able to try a lot of things.<br><br>First off I love the atmosphere and decor of the place. Upscale bayou? can that exist? seems like they were able to do it. Plus its nice and dark and comfortable.<br><br>One thing I recall is how great the service is EVERY TIME i go. Three different visits.. three different servers.. top notch each time.<br><br>Food!<br><br>Appetizers<br><br>Wings:<br>Delicious! These are smoked, fried, and then sauced. I hate(strong word on purpose) baked wings. I thought I was going to hate these but the combo of the smoked then fried works amazingly. It allows them to only flash fry for crisp. This keeps the wings juicy and plump but with the fried crispy skin that wings should have.<br><br>Brisket Fire-Pie:<br>Don&#39;t bother :/ I knew this was risky but I had a pizza craving. Normally BBQ pizzas have way to much BBQ sauce. This was the opposite it had very little sauce.. so little that it had no flavor impact leaving you wondering what that funky after taste is.<br><br>Cornbread:<br>Strong corn flavor.. not overly sweet. Could feel the grease/butter levels killing me not so slowly. But was good to the taste buds.<br>-----------------<br>BBQ<br><br>Pulled Pork:<br>Nice smoke flavor and good moisture content without being overly fatty. Not the best I&#39;ve had but no complaints.<br><br>Brisket:<br>Same feelings as the pork. It was good and executed properly but certainly not the best I&#39;ve ever had. None of the BBQ was overly salty but some of it was to far on the other end of the scope and could have used some more salt. There was no real bark on the brisket which was a little disappointing.<br><br>Smoke Links:<br>I didn&#39;t care for these at all. They were to fatty for my taste and needed more... something in your face. I think everyone agreed these were the our least favorite items.<br><br>Baby Back Ribs:<br>Very tasty ribs but surprisingly not my favorite out of the three offered. These are usually the safe best for best ribs at whatever place your at. There was something out of whack with the meat itself. It failed to really pick up the smoke flavor maybe? They were moist and tender and fall off the bone. But fall off the bone on the side of smoked to long.<br><br>Beef Ribs:<br>Surprisingly lean for beef ribs. Since they were so lean these could have used a little more time in the smoke unlike the baby backs. Beef ribs take a much longer time to break down to perfection.<br><br>St Louis Style Ribs:<br>YUM! Best ribs on the menu. Next time this is all I will order in the rib category. Flavor was great., meat was great., still a little over done but it took nothing away from them. I would come back for this alone.<br>-------------------<br><br>Sides<br><br>Mac &amp; Cheese:<br>Delicious but they went the fake cheese route. It is hard to make good mac and cheese the old fashion way. Its hard in small quantity let alone restaurant quantity. I would rather have them understand this and serve it with primarily fake cheese and be tasty then try and do from scratch and serve me curdled cheese fail.<br><br>Pecan Cole Slaw:<br>Also sexy! Crisp, cold, refreshing, and not soggy. The nuts were a nice addition but if they could have somehow brought it out more in the dish it would have been ever better.<br><br>Potato Salad:<br>Mmmmmm. This was great and a tie for best side dish with the mac and cheese. Be warned.. This is HEAVY. Its probably 90% mayo but its potato salad.. its not healthy don&#39;t try and make it healthy. They did it right. It took a year off my life and I loved every bite of it. Its the bad years anyway! Creamy, perfect amount of mustard, great seasoning, lots of fresh dill.<br><br>Beans:<br>Interesting.. Sweet but not grossly sweet like some. Smokey but almost to a crazy level. When I tasted this I honestly felt like I was eating something with a liquid tobacco smoke flavor. It also had a lot of what was probably the BBQ beef in it. Not sure what I thought about this.<br><br>Planned Return Order:<br>Wings<br>St Louis Ribs<br>Mac &amp; Cheese<br>Potato Salad<br>Pecan Coleslaw<br><br>Get these if nothing else and I would be shocked if you didn&#39;t leave grinning ear to ear.<br><br>Pros:<br>Great Service<br>Great Atmospheric<br>Acceptable Great to OK dish ratio<br>10% off for yelpsters!<br><br>Cons:<br>Awkward Location<br>Awkward Parking<br>Pricey<br><br>For those still stumped by the &#34;how can fall off the bone be bad&#34; the best test for ribs done correctly would be ribs tender enough to pull apart with your teeth but ones you can pick up and hold by a bone and not have fall apart. If you pick up ribs by the bone and the meat stays on the plate and the bone comes up clean its been neglected. I know this sounds crazy to most but when you have enough ribs done properly you will taste and appreciate a rib that was on as long as it was supposed to be and no longer.",1/30/2010,4,7,3,2,3,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Up7WzleploEKfjciDs7cGg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-kn7Y9WDWKRL4DjlZ9KARA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/P0-VxFGrXE8SatBqKabsRQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sBtVkbhzzvs4rPeYd4mEdg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PFjrB1b49i8NHekiFKld6Q/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/l_N_1PJdYz84Js0C76BzQQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3oEMAk7Do-a1KfjDTZfjmw/o.jpg,,,

Before we got to order, the server was placing our water cups in front of us. The next moment surprised my whole table because the waitress mishandled a water cup and all the water in one cup fell onto my girlfriend next to me. I was so caught off-guard that I didn&#39;t even realize that half of my dress shirt got caught in the splash zone too. My girlfriend was just wearing a one-layered sweater so she didn&#39;t really have an option to change. As a result, apologies were given and as the waitress handed us napkins, she smiled and told my girlfriend &#34;you still look good though.&#34; Everyone at the table had an easy-going personality, so we just shrugged off the situation. Thinking about what happened, I would not be surprised if someone else would go nuts about getting soaked before the appetizers came. <br><br>Now onto the actual food. To the recommendation of my friends who have been here a handful of times, I ordered the fried chicken with mac &amp; cheese and thought it was a great dish. The breading had a great crunchy texture and every bite of the chicken was tender and moist. The biggest recommendation we had was to try the beef brisket, so my girlfriend got that. We both shared our plates with each other, and I thought the brisket had a great smoky flavor to it. The beef was so tender that you could easily slice through it with a fork. Although the mac &amp; cheese tasted really good, I felt that it was a little too heavy for my own tastes. I can&#39;t complain about any of the other sides because they all tasted great and were seasoned well. <br><br>My girlfriend still liked the restaurant because the food was great and the décor/layout of the restaurant seemed nice. Having been to many barbecue restaurants dispersed throughout California, I thought the restaurant was fairly priced and the food was top-notch. By the time we got to our check, I asked my girlfriend if she was still wet, and she said &#34;yeah a little.&#34; It would&#39;ve been nice if management stepped in and gave us a cookie to turn her frown upside down, but our waitress was probably too embarrassed to tell the manager anything.

When I reached out to some AZ Yelpers to find out where I can find some serious BBQ in Phoenix, almost every person mentioned Bobby&#39;s name. <br><br>Bobby Q is a huge place that looks more like an upscale steakhouse rather than a BBQ joint. The inside is dimly lit and has a fancy, upscale decor. They also have two big bars and a banquet room. <br><br>Right when our party of four was seated we received some delicious house made cornbread with sweet butter. After devouring the yummy cornbread we ordered two appetizers, their Q-Rolls and their Fire Pie Pizza topped with beef brisket. The Q-Rolls were similar to those pigs in a blanket everyone loves as a child.  Instead of mini hot dogs, Bobby stuffs the little flaky pastries with juicy beef brisket. The Q-Rolls were incredible alone but when dipped in the chipotle sauce that comes with the app, it gave the rolls an even more fabulous taste.  The beef brisket pizza was good but not great. They put lots of cheese on the pizza but not enough Bobby Q sauce or beef brisket. <br><br>For dinner I ordered their three meat combo with pulled pork, beef brisket and St. Louis spare ribs. My fiancé ordered the Prime Rib with Chimichuri shrimp dinner. My dinner was big enough to feed at least two people. Every meat was phenomenal. The pulled pork and beef brisket were both juicy, tender and incredibly flavorful. The St. Louis spare ribs were falling-off- the-bone tender and had a nice smoky flavor. My girls Prime Rib was also really good but her shrimp were burnt, rubbery, and had almost no Chimichuri sauce on them, which upset her a little bit. Once your dinners are brought to your table, they also bring out two big containers filled with warm sweet Bobby Q sauce and spicy Bobby Q sauce. Both of these Bobby Q sauces were great but since I&#39;m a huge fan of spicy I preferred the spicy sauce over the sweet one. My dinner came with three sides while my girls came with two. These are the sides we got.<br>Mac and cheese (we both got this) <br>Pecan Coleslaw<br>Loaded Baked Potato<br>Roasted Corn<br>All of these sides were great but my favorite of the bunch was the Mac and Cheese. I don&#39;t remember what my other dinner companions ordered but I do remember they all said they loved what they had.<br>To wash down all this great Bobby Q, we all had huge glasses of their house made sweet tea, which was super sweet and delicious.<br><br>Even though everyone was full, we all decided to share a slice of their Sub Zero Banana Cream Pie for dessert. This pie was served ice cold and was more like a piece of banana cheese cake than a regular banana cream pie. This pie had an amazing banana flavor and was topped with lots of caramel sauce. To our surprise, after we finished the pie, our server brought us some home made complimentary cinnamon sugar donuts. These little things were wonderful, I just wish I would have been a little less full so I could have enjoyed them more. <br><br>The service and prices here were both great. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. Since it was our first time there he really helped us out by making suggestions and telling us what their most popular dishes are. The prices were very reasonable seeing that you get so much food.  <br><br>If your a fan of BBQ then I guarantee you will be a fan of Bobby Q.

The more sedate flavors of the sides were a good counterpoint for the intensely savory ribs. We shared desserts -- the chocolate overload was good, and the peach cobbler was not overly sugared like it usually is in most establishments.

Everything was perfect! These chefs really know what they are doing. The chicken was so tender like butter and fried to perfection, so crispy. Not too hard, not too soft it was just right! I loved how the mashed potatoes were made mixed in with the skin, those r my favorite kind. The gravy was incredible and the Mac n cheese OMG! Amazing!! Everything was so hot &amp; fresh.<br><br>Our waiter Harrison was delightful. He was very knowledgeable about the restaurant, menu &amp; how the meats are prepared &amp; cooked. He got our order in &amp; brought it out in a timely fashion, and came back to check on us often. Upon leaving there were about 5 different employees all telling us to have a great night &amp; thanks for coming in. All very eager to wish us well.

Big parking lot and a popular place that attests to its good food. Reservations are on Yelp. We shared a three meat platter but only ordered two meats: Beef rib and double brisket and chose Mac and cheese and beans.  We had their cornbread as a starter and asked for more. The beef rib was soooo good and had a wonderfully rich flavor. The brisket was a good smoky flavor and very tender. Mac and cheese was yummy but the beans were a little crunchy although the flavor was great. I asked to try both the spicy and sweet bbq sauce. Both were good but I like the spicy more!

We started off with the Q rolls, which are rolls stuffed with brisket, and we also had fried zucchini, which was delicious. The zucchini was kind of thin, which I&#39;ve never seen before with fried zucchini. and it came with what looked to be a homemade ranch sauce. <br><br>I also ordered the pineapple drink for my cocktail which was very delicious, and my friends got a Mai Tai and a sangria.<br><br>The restaurant also provides complimentary cornbread and it was fantastic, it was more of like a cornbread cake and it came with butter.

You are allowed to choose one side and they have many to choose from. There was not much sauce on the pulled pork and I thought it was fine but nothing special. The mashed potatoes were very creamy and delicious though. It also came with a pickle. My friends got a half rack of baby back ribs as well as the pulled pork plate, and it looked like she had more sauce on her pulled pork versus my sandwich.<br><br>Waitservice was also good. The reason this place gets four stars for me and not five is because prices are pretty high, my sandwich was $17 and our appetizers were 14 to $15. Plates range from like $23 to $29. The other reason is what I said previously, I feel like a barbecue place should have great barbecue and my sandwich was just okay.<br><br>That being said, everything else we ate here was fantastic so I would return when in town.

I want to first preface by saying that this is not a place you come with a half empty stomach because you would regret not eating more.<br>The secret behind Bobby Q&#39;s barbeque lies within the slow cooking process over Tennessee hickory wood paired with the perfect blend of spices such as the special dry rub .The result is succulent hand-pulled pork, smoky sausage links, fork-tender brisket, and ribs that fall right off the bone. Three different ribs are offered (St. Louis, Texas, and baby back) as well as chicken, salmon, burgers, and hand-cut steaks. The sides are a great accompaniment, but the meat is the show stopper here. I was not a fan of the Mac and cheese but everything else was top-notch. We finished our meal with the ginormous sized Mud pie and couldn&#39;t finish the whole thing even though we really tried. The service was top-notch, and they even gave us a bag of fresh fried donuts, dusted with cinnamon sugar on the house.

That said, Bobby Q has temporarily brought me out of retirement like Floyd Mayweather looking for a quick payday. IMO, any review less than 5 stars for this place is strictly a matter of personal preference or some one-off issue unreflective of the mass experience.  I had:<br><br>3 meat combo w/ baby back ribs, brisket, and smoked sausage. Plus, corn bread, pecan coleslaw, Mac n Cheese, mashed potatoes, and Q Rolls.<br><br>I&#39;m actually a relatively small-portion eater, but sitting outside the restaurant and smelling the blissful bbq aroma, while ordering, was like walking into a pre-COVID Costco on an empty stomach. I found myself wanting to sample everything and leaving with way more than I bargained for. Unlike Costco though, I didn&#39;t wake up the next day with a &#39;what the hell did I just do&#39; hangover (I mean why does everything taste so good at Costco and crappy when I make it?) Getting back on track, I barely put a dent in my order and have now had my original dinner, a microwaved bbq breakfast, and I&#39;m looking forward to lunch with the last of my leftovers.<br><br>Now, I&#39;ve always considered myself more of a Tri Tip person, but... damn, Bobby Q&#39;s brisket was amazing. Basically, if bbq could be sold on a cotton candy stick, Bobby Q&#39;s tender, smoked brisket would be the top seller. The ribs were equally tender, and which one you prefer is likely a matter of preference, but there&#39;s really no point in me trying to convince you either way. Like a debate over the GOAT in basketball, the Kobe, Lebron, Jordan argument is never ending and there&#39;s really no wrong answer. Although, whichever one of three players above you like the least, that&#39;s the smoked sausage. It was good, don&#39;t get me wrong, but it&#39;s smoked sausage competing against brisket and baby backs, what can I say?<br><br>Regarding the sides:<br><br>Cornbread: Good, took it to go so I&#39;m not sure what they offer in-restaurant but some honey butter would&#39;ve taken it over the top.<br><br>Pecan coleslaw: Loved it. No idea why other places don&#39;t do this. If you like coleslaw, you&#39;ll be in heaven.<br><br>Mashed potatoes: Good, but the gravy made them great. I got the gravy on the side, and I&#39;m not sure why, but when I opened it, it smelled like clam chowder to me. I thought I&#39;d got a bonus item somehow. When I couldn&#39;t find the gravy, I circled back to my bonus chowder and realized my error. Regardless, it was bomb.<br><br>Mac n Cheese: Good. Generally par for the course. Although, I have known some places to blow it somehow. This is not one of those places. <br><br>Finally, the Q Rolls: (Insert four letter word here starting with the letter F and ending with u, c, k.) These egg roll looking things stuffed with tender brisket are a game changer. I mean, c&#39;mon, dipped in a special bbq ranch sauce and a light crunch in every bite? It&#39;s stupid really. If heaven doesn&#39;t have this recipe, I&#39;m choosing reincarnation if given the choice. You need to order these!<br><br>Final word: Try it or diet? The suspense is killing you right? <br><br>Definitely Try it! Then try it for breakfast the next day, and one more time for the hell of it. I&#39;m in a hotel with a crappy microwave and it was actually just as good this morning, no lie. Your welcome.

This place is pretty large inside too. <br><br>They have a gorgeous covered patio with really pretty lighting. There&#39;s even a TV on the patio for all of the sports heads.

He was also kind enough to give me some great recommendations as far as hiking and sight seeing in the area. A true gem with heart and personality. <br><br>The drinks are.... wowza! I had their Q-lada which was similar to a piña colada but with strawberry purée and damnit... It was phenomenal! It was almost too pretty to drink. It came garnished with fresh coconut and pineapple and came l served in a HUGE ass glass! Shoutout to the bartender who hooked this drink up because it was FABULOUS! Yes, I was feelin&#39; it.<br><br>And last but not least.... that FOOD!!! Woooooo babyyyy! Those RIBS were the truth! The TRUTH. Period. I ordered their 1/2 rack of baby back ribs w/ mac and cheese and ranch beans. It was delicious!!! The ribs definitely stole the show. They were falling off the bone and were oh so tender.

It was a hit! And those donuts? And even BIGGER hit! That cornbread was so moist and the butter melted as soon as I spread it on the top. It was melting in my mouth! So good! Derrick even gave me some more to-go! Ha! Like I REALLY needed it, but it was so damn delicious.<br><br>I can&#39;t even talk about the donuts now because now I&#39;m craving. They were perfect.

We ordered the *Platter Sampler* since it was a great way to try out their wares. We selected brisket, baby back ribs, and St. Louis style ribs for our meat choices and a mac as our side. Our server asked if we wanted their Original or Spicy BBQ sauces and she obliged when we requested for both. They give you relatively large vats of this sauce, so you basically are smothering everything in it. Otherwise, the baby back ribs were probably the most impressive. Good tender meat with that overcooked, fall-off-the-bone quality. The sauce on the St. Louis ribs wasn&#39;t anything I was accustomed too; a bit astringent and not exactly vinegary. The brisket was pretty boring, dry, and over cooked. Again, the sauce helped greatly to enhance its quality. <br><br>We also sampled a bit of their lunch special for $9.95, the *BLC Sandwich* aka the bacon, lettuce, and CHICKEN. It was a very good deal and the one half we consumed was actually rather tasty; meaty and juicy chicken with a large helping of bacon, lettuce, and sauce. <br><br>Service was fantastic and the outdoor patio was relaxing and comfortable with the cushions, although said cushioning was kind of grody and caked with spilled food. There&#39;s a lot of BBQ in Phoenix and this one is very much well-loved by the locals. Again, not real BBQ in my opinion, but you go for the ambiance... and good deals!",4/1/2019,4,3,4,2,2,False,False,,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CObputT3rITgLyDab4WTrg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n-mDJrRwTaeX7yCZF3X3UA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ufBZM3z2h2WyFsZkTJtjgA/o.jpg,,,,,,,

We were welcomed by him and asked if we had ever been to a Bobby Q&#39;s to which the answer was no. He gave a quick background about the restaurant chain and how it came about. Advised their angus steaks are aged 60 days and cut in-house and their BBQ meats are smoked for 22hrs (Pretty sure those were the timeframes but I could be wrong). Went over the menu and gave the drink menu. <br><br>Started out with the Cajun Shrimp appetizer <br>-shrimp not over cooked<br>-sautéed in butter cajun seasoning and beer<br>-garlic bread <br>Holy crap this was soooo good!! The shrimp was &#34;juicy&#34; which is not something I would ever describe shrimp as but I&#39;m not quite sure how else to describe it. It was DELICIOUS and not tough or chewy. I&#39;m a sauce fanatic and I literally wanted to drink the sauce out of the dish but didn&#39;t think that was appropriate so I opted to just dip the garlic bread in the sauce <br><br>The cornbread was dense and sweet and didn&#39;t fall apart - yummmmy<br><br>Dinner came out within 10 min, right after the shrimp was finished. I got the pick 2 meats as suggested by Jared because I couldn&#39;t decide between the beef brisket or the pulled pork - and with the pick 2 I got both!!  The pulled pork was my FAVORITE of the 2. It was fall off the fork tender and melted in my mouth. Again since I&#39;m a sucker for good sauce I asked for more BBQ sauce to which Jared brought out both spicy and regular. The spicy wasn&#39;t too spicy at all and had just the perfect amount of &#34;spice&#34;, that was my favorite of the two BBQ sauces.  I dipped my potato in the bbq sauce and even my mac and cheese it was so good I could drink it!<br><br>For my sides I had the loaded baked potato without chives and the mac and cheese. <br>Baked Potato - The skin was baked with salt which is my fav!! <br>I asked for a side of butter since it came with just sour cream, bacon bits and shredded cheese. It was good but just a standard baked tater and since I seem to love extra condiments I personally could have went for more sour cream and cheese but I&#39;m not going to complain. My friend had the ranch baked beans and next time those are what I will get in place of the baked potato. <br><br>Mac n cheese -creamy and thick. Rich in flavor but not too rich - I loved it and will def order again<br><br>Let me tell you how much I loved the music!! It included 80&#39;s pop Deniece Williams-Let&#39;s hear it for the boy, Motown; The Supremes, 80&#39;s rock; Loverboy-Turn me loose, Katrina and the Waves-Walkin on sunshine, Dusty Springfield-Son of a Preacher Man, Wild Child-Play that funky music white boy, Evelyn King-love come down, Queen and the list of awesome music goes on and on!!<br><br>Had a perfect front row view of the 76ers vs Rockets game and all. <br><br>Christy, one of the managers came to check on us about halfway through dinner to make sure everything was great and make sure everything was acceptable <br><br>Lots of drink choices and I couldn&#39;t choose just 1, so I got 3 :-)<br><br>Watermelon cooler with tajín rim - Strong but delicious <br><br>Q-lada -Toasted coconut rim with some type of coconut cream and Pieces of strawberries blended <br>Cannot taste any alcohol in it with the light rum and it was super delicious and refreshing <br><br>Pineapple Passion - Served in a frozen pineapple with a dried pineapple slice and tangerine slice<br>Creamy and strong but delicious - similar to a pina colada<br><br>Between the busser(s) and Jared, the empty plates were cleared promptly <br><br>Dessert, I was so full from shoveling all the delicious eats in my face but, I couldn&#39;t pass up their dessert!!  I got the banana sub zero square with warm caramel drizzle.  It&#39;s frozen banana pudding with a graham cracker walnut cinnamon bottom crust (I think that&#39;s what the crust was, that&#39;s what it tastes like). It was also very good but I could only eat a few bites and opted for a to go box to enjoy later. <br><br>Christy came by after we finished dessert to see how everything was and even got my dessert to go box!<br><br>Never felt rushed at any point throughout dinner/drinks/dessert. <br><br>I didn&#39;t want to leave and felt like I could hangout here all night!! But, after 2 hours I figured I better get my a$$ up so other people can enjoy this place just as much as I did!!<br><br>Just when you think it cannot get any better, our check showed up with a bag of FRESH, HOT donuts fried in peanut oil and covered in cinnamon sugar!!  OMG!

Before my last visit, it had been a solid 10 years since my last time. I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect as I didn&#39;t remember any of it. I was excited to see how good the BBQ was and to support a local place. <br><br>FOOD: We ordered the &#34;Whole Hog&#34; which comes with 2 types of ribs (your choice), 2 types of meat (your choice), and 3 sides (your choice). This sampler platter was $55, but a great trial for three people. The food only took about 15 minutes to be prepared and brought to our table. Holy cow it was a great feast! My personal favorite from that meal was the St. Louis Ribs. Those ribs were cooked to perfection and fell off the bone with amazing flavor. The sausage was also extremely delicious with a hint of spice. The sides we chose were mac &amp; cheese, baked beans, and roasted corn. All of these were exceptional and well worth it. The food alone will have me coming back to try other menu options. <br><br>SERVICE: Our server was Dustin. He was a really nice guy who knew a lot about the menu and how all this great food is prepared. One of the people in my group had a dairy allergy, and Dustin was able to help accommodate us on what we could order.

I&#39;ve only been to the Grand Canyon a few times. This was my first visit to Bobby Q.<br><br>I can&#39;t believe it took me so long. I have sampled their BBQ at events, but this is my first visit to their establishment. So being a native, I grew up going to Bobby McGee&#39;s (one of owner Bob Sikora&#39;s original endeavors here in the Valley). In 2005, he turned his attention to BBQ and opened up Bobby Q. You can smell the meat smoking as you get out of your car in the parking lot. The menu has a variety of meats to choose from like tender brisket, pulled pork, chicken, prime rib, steaks, fish and burgers. The brisket and pork is slow cooked for hours at a low temperature. They smoke their meat with Almond and Mesquite wood and use a nice blend of spices for the dry rub. For BBQ sauce, Bobby Q has both a sweet and spicy Carolina sauce available. They have a variety of sides to choose from for your entree but I highly recommend their cheesy mac &amp; cheese. It&#39;s so gooey and delicious! My sliced-brisket sandwich was amazing and I savored each bite. If you aren&#39;t a meat lover (why would you come here if not?), the Biltmore location has a some vegan dishes and other healthy options on the menu. Bobby Q is known for their famous corn bread that is complimentary if you order something. They are really good (especially with butter on it) and are made fresh daily. Each table also gets a complimentary bag of fresh-made mini doughnuts dipped in cinnamon sugar for the ride home (mine didn&#39;t make it to the car). Overall, prices are very reasonable and portions are large. This was a fun experience and I look forward to future visits. The restaurant can be a little loud at times but it does have a fun community feel to it. In addition to the Biltmore location, Bobby Q also has a location in Mesa.",7/6/2019,5,5,12,8,12,False,True,7/10/2019,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Bar2nmGduDnWTQOTZFz2Ug/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aE9JMj0jYj2cRyhiJenkQA/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DfizL5S9pf1FjPrMeoAg1A/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CiRmPYqPvMiG1gC5X_DxsQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xlQFXhu3u_cVDvk5X7Wppw/o.jpg,,,,,

As I was driving my little brother searched up a place to eat and he wanted to try some barbeque. <br><br>We opted to try Bobby Q because another place was closed on Monday, and we thought the name + the numerous reviews was appealing. <br><br>We made a reservation online for 2pm but when we arrived, it wasn&#39;t packed so we were just able to get seated easily for 2. They also have an outdoor patio area where you can sit and enjoy a waterfall, we almost sat there but we decided to let the host sit us wherever was most convenient for them. <br><br>We were sat and asked what we wanted to drink by our waiter Chris(topher). He&#39;s got his greeting and mantra down, &#34;Have you been here before?&#34; <br>Us: No we&#39;re just passing by.<br>Chris: &#34;Where are you all from?&#34; <br>Us: Los Angeles area<br>Chris: &#34;Very cool, I&#39;m from California, San Bernardino myself!&#34;<br><br>I heard this repeated to other customers who sat down. He&#39;s a very personable waiter. <br><br>We wanted to try a variety of things so my brother and I opted for the Whole Hog&#39;s Variety. It was about $54 but we already dented it. It came with a choice of a variety of different things but we chose: sausage, beef brisket, beef ribs, and St. Louis ribs.<br><br>Sausage: I thought it was good but nothing too special. Perhaps I&#39;m just not a fan of sausages done this way, but by no means was it bad. <br><br>Beef brisket: This was probably the star of the dish. It was amazingly delicious. It was very juicy and tender and the sauce didn&#39;t overpower the meat taste. This is something I highly recommend.<br><br>Beef Ribs: I&#39;m a sucker for beef ribs, and these were so good the meat came off the bones easily. The flavor was a little bland but that was perfect, because the sauce provided the needed salt.<br><br>St Louis Pork Ribs: They were also really good and they melted off their bones, but the St. Louis pork ribs were too salty. I was only able to eat 2 because I couldn&#39;t keep eating it, but the flavors were good. <br><br>For the sides we got the: Mac and cheese, corn, and pecan cole slaw.<br><br>I originally wanted more vegetables as a side because vegetables help compliment meat, but my little brother wanted the mac and cheese, and the corn. So I chose the cole slaw as a means to cut the richness of the different barbeque meats. <br><br>The mac and cheese was very rich, and I couldn&#39;t eat too much of it because of how rich both the entree and the side was. <br><br>I was also so-so with the corn, but as a disclaimer, I&#39;m very impartial to corn to begin with. To me, unless it&#39;s naturally very sweet they&#39;re almost wasted calories. This was just a personal preference, but my brother wanted it.<br><br>The pecan cole slaw was perfect. If anything I would have liked a little more acidity in it, but it was such a good addition to the meal. After a bite of the rich pork ribs, the cole slaw really helps cleanse the palette. It was very refreshing. <br><br>Overall we were very pleased by this restaurant. Our bill came out to be about $39 per person (tax and a hefty tip) but we probably had enough food to last 3 meals.",11/26/2018,5,3,5,1,3,False,True,1/1/2019,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K7KJqcorOYYlSWc1jNPghg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U_kL59_DwfIO_uPR5YjbTg/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mJFOtEj7NL4QwdWoswGaEA/o.jpg,,,,,,,

We chose the sausage which was super tender and packed with flavor and two different kinds of ribs that were to die for. I asked for some extra sauce and a toasted bun, and Dustin brought the bun with practically a pitcher of BBQ sauce (new best friend). The sides we ordered were the roasted corn, baked beans, and the mac n&#39; cheese. I could only eat the beans which were fantastic, and the other two people loved their sides as well.

The service at this place it top notch and far surpasses that of any 5 star, fine dining establishments I&#39;ve ever been to. I am a firm believer that food may come up short from time to time.

It&#39;s a bummer when that happens but most often people will return to try it again. But... a server is on stage, in front of their guests, until the last curtain call. They really have no room for error without getting scrutinized and skinned alive. And they tend to take the hit for the entire restaurant. If the food is bad, for some reason it&#39;s easier for people to take it out on the server. If it took an hour to get a table, somehow it&#39;s the servers fault.

He was honest about one of them, the Watermelon Cooler, and let me know it&#39;s not for everyone and it gets sent back quite a bit. I ordered it and LOVED it. It tasted like a Jalapeno infused, Watermelon Margarita. I love spicy margaritas and this cocktail was right up my alley! <br>The food was also superb. I had beef ribs as well as 1/2 rack baby backs, accompanied with Mashed Potatoes and Mac N CHeese! <br>PSA: There is absolutely no dainty way to eat the beef ribs. Just accept the facts, get in touch with your inner Caveman, and go to town! Nom, Nom, Nom... while you&#39;re feasting, try to remember you are in public, people may be watching, so keep the growling to a minimum. <br>At the end of our meal, we were so full, we regretfully declined dessert. We did however find a tiny bit of room for the complimentary mini donuts. I actually asked if we could order some to go. To my pleasant surprise, they sell them by the dozen! And, to my ultimate surprise our server brought us a few extra donuts, told us not to leave, and came back with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!! Whhaaaaaaat?? Omg... mind blown and super yummy! All in all Bobby Q. has it together from start to finish and you will not be disappointed! Be sure to ask for Donald, he&#39;s one of the best!",7/19/2018,5,3,4,1,2,False,True,1/4/2019,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WtULIZbcha02ZN9ON6yMKQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U2OTai9WcGYAvUAnp3E5cQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FRa-TfO9tfFZXO3jRE8dxw/o.jpg,,,,,,,

Upon arriving in Phoenix, i obv checked yelp to see what the best eats were. Based on the reviews, this seemed like a no brainer. <br><br>Its basically an off the highway stop for grub. The outdoor eating area looked more appealing than inside. The service was great but i just wasnt crazy about the bbq or drinks unfortunately. We shared the Q rolls and a both ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The Q rolls tasted like they were from Applebees and the pulled pork just wasnt juicy at all.  The mac n cheese was actually pretty good. Portions are pretty large also. <br><br>The drinks were 95% mixer. They give you unlimited cornbread which was different than your average. It was a circle of  soft and buttery goodness. They also give you free donuts at the end of your meal. These were the winner for me. THEY WERE SO GOOOOD! <br><br>However, the service was great! Our waiter was very attentive and offered if we wanted more cornbread and whatever else we needed. <br><br>I unfortunately would not return here again. It just seems like people like it cause its a convenient &#34;real food&#34; stop on the highway. Its definitely not the best bbq iv ever had and it is certainty not worth the hype. If i do return,  itll be for those damn donuts!",6/11/2018,3,3,3,1,1,False,True,1/18/2019,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6db2jKaHobGynQc_eQPmNw/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8Kl6_XGveEBROLLjSIo2SQ/o.jpg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/trZIjqDjnurjbiwvyCO0eQ/o.jpg,,,,,,,
